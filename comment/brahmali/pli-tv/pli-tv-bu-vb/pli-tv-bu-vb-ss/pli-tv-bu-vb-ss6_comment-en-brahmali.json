  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.5": "I have rendered _muñja_-reed and _pabbaja_-reed with the single word “reed.” I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6": "That is, twelve _sugata-vidatthis_ (“standard hand-spans”) long and seven _sugata-vidatthis_ wide inside. [](Sp.1.348) says: _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” Ajahn Thanissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the monastic saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. Based on this I assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was 160 centimeters. If we assume, as Ajahn Thnaissaro does in BMC I, that the forearm is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a handpsan of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard forearm of 120 cm, a standard hand-span of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth of 5 cm."
