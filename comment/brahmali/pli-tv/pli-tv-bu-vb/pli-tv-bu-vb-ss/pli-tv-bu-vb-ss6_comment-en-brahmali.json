  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.5": "I have rendered _muñja_-reed and _pabbaja_-reed with the single word “reed”. I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.6.6": "That is, twelve _sugata-vidatthis_ (“standard hand-spans”) long and seven _sugata-vidatthis_ wide inside. [Sp.1.348](): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm (_hattha_) measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅguli_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅguli_) of 5 cm.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:3.16.3": "The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries, e.g. at [Sp.4.294](): _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṃsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a _guhā_ made of rocks, a _guhā_ made of wood, a _guhā_ made of dirt”. And at [Sp.ṭ.3.294](): _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṃ pabbatānaṃ antarā, ekasmiṃyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṃ mahāvivaraṃ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them)”. In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory."
