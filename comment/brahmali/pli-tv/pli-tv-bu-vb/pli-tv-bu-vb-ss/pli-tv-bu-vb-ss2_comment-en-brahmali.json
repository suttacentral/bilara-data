  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.6": "“Precincts” renders _pariveṇa_, sometimes rendered as “cell”, for which there is no proper basis. The _pariveṇa_ is the area surrounding a building. That it is not an indoor area can be seen from ([](pli-tv-kd16:3.8.14)) where a _pariveṇa_ is said to get muddy, upon which the Buddha allows gravel, paving stones, and drains. The _pariveṇa_ is often mentioned in connection with keeping a building tidy, specifically as an area that is to be swept, as in the present context. It seems natural to conclude that this must refer to the area, or part of it, that surrounds a building. This is confirmed by the commentaries. [Sp.ṭ.3.117](): _Pariveṇanti ekekassa vihārassa parikkhepabbhantaraṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: 11 meters surrounding each individual dwelling.” Sometimes, but not always it seems, this area would be walled in. [Sp.ṭ.2.103](): _Pariveṇanti mahāvihārassa abbhantare visuṃ visuṃ pākāraparicchinnaṭṭhānaṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: a separate place delimited by a wall within a large monastery.” This fits with the fact that _pariveṇas_ are said to be constructed ([](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.9)), as well as the frequent mention in the Vinaya Piṭaka of _koṭṭhakas_, “gateways”. Gateways would make no sense without a surrounding wall. On a more general note, the term _pariveṇa_ is not found in the four main Nikāyas, and in the Vinaya Piṭaka it is found only in narratives, minor rules on conduct, and explanatory material. This suggests it may not have existed in the earliest period of Buddhist monasticism. The earliest buildings and monasteries would have been simple, without much embelishment, especially the surrounding walls.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:2.1.6": "I have rendered _otiṇṇo vipariṇatena cittena_ with the single word “lustful.” This means that the definition for _vipariṇataṃ_ is missing from my translation. Here is the Pali, followed by a translation: _Vipariṇatanti rattampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Duṭṭhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Mūḷhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti_; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a deluded mind is distorted. But in this case ‘distorted’ refers to a mind with desire.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:3.4.28^a": "By throwing, dropping, etc."
