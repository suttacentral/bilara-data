  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.9.7": "Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues in Buddhist Monastic Code I, page 105, that it was the novice monk who emitted semen. But these rules concern monks, not novices. In the present case the Buddha specfically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisea_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his readng is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisea_ offenses can be occurred by indirect stimulation. I disagree. These cases are limited in scope and do not always include all the factors required for the committing of an offense."
