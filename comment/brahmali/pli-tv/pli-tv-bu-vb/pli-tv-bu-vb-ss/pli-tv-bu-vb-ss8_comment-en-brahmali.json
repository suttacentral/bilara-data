  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.21": "“Robeˮ renders _saṅghāṭi_. A _saṅghāṭi_ is normally understood to refer to one of the three robes of a _bhikkhu_ or one of the five of a _bhikkhunī_. It can then be translated as “outer robe” to distinguish it from the _uttarasaṅga_ (“the upper robe”) and the _antaravāsaka_ (“the lower robe” or sarong). Upper robe is not, however, always a satisfactory rendering of _saṅghāṭi_, as can be seen from a number of different contexts in the Vinaya Piṭaka. There are in fact three different uses of the word, ranging in meaning from “robe” in general to “upper robe”—denoting either the _uttarasaṅga_, _saṅghāṭi_, or both—to “outer robe”, which is the only case when it specifically refers an individual robe. I thus translate _saṅghāṭi_ in three different ways, as either “robe”, “upper robe”, or “outer robe”. I use the context to decide which one is appropriate in each particular case.",
