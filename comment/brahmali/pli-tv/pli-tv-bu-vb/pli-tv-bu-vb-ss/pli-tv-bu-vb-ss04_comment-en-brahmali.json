  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:2.7": "I have rendered _otiṇṇo vipariṇatena cittena_ with the single word “lustful.” This means that the definition for _vipariṇataṃ_ is missing from my translation. Here is the Pali, followed by a translation: _Vipariṇatanti rattampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Duṭṭhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Mūḷhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti_; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a confused mind is distorted. But in this case ‘distorted’ refers to a mind with desire.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:2.14": "I have rendered _mātugāmassa santike_, “in the presence of a woman,” simply as “woman.” Since woman has already been defined above, this definition falls away in my translation. Here is the Pali of the missing part, followed by a translation: _Mātugāmassa santiketi mātugāmassa sāmantā, mātugāmassa avidūre._; “in the presence of a woman: near a woman, close to a woman.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:3.1.18": "MS has missed out the ellipses points between _vematiko_ and _itthisaññī_, that is, between “but he is unsure of it” and “but he perceives it as a woman.”"
