  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:2.6": "I have rendered _otiṇṇo vipariṇatena cittena_ with the single word “lustful.” This means that the definition for _vipariṇataṃ_ is missing from my translation. Here is the Pali, followed by a translation: _Vipariṇatanti rattampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Duṭṭhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Mūḷhampi cittaṃ vipariṇataṃ. Api ca rattaṃ cittaṃ imasmiṃ atthe adhippetaṃ vipariṇatanti_; “distorted: a mind with desire is distorted, a mind with anger is distorted, a deluded mind is distorted. But in this case ‘distorted’ refers to a mind with desire.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4:2.12": "I have rendered _mātugāmassa santike_, “in the presence of a woman,” simply as “woman.” Since woman has already been defined above, this definition falls away in my translation. Here is the Pali of the missing part, followed by a translation: _Mātugāmassa santiketi mātugāmassa sāmantā, mātugāmassa avidūre._; “in the presence of a woman: near a woman, close to a woman.”"
