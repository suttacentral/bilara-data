  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.1.13": "_Suṭṭhu, devāti_, literally, “It is good, sir.” The exact meaning is not clear to me.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.26": "_Putto vā pitaraṃ pattheti pitā vā puttaṃ pattheti_. The meaning of _pattheti_ is not clear. Bhikkhu Bodhi, in Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, {AN 10.45}, translates it as “longs for.” {Sp.2.597} gives the meaning, _Ghātetuṃ icchati_, “Wishes to strike/kill,” which is not the usual meaning of this word. SED, however, gives “to seize or fall upon, attack, assail” under _prārthayate_, which is the Sanskrit equivalent of _pattheti_."
