I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8:2.4.2": "In agreement with {Sp.1.220}, I understand _paṭivijānantassa_ to refer to the listener rather than the speaker. Grammatically the word could refer to either (it can be regarded as a genitive agreeing with _bhaṇantassa_, thus referring to the speaker, or it can be regarded as a dative of the person spoken to, that is, the listener), but logically it seems it must refer to the listener. _Paṭivijānantassa_ refers to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, rather than knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener.",
