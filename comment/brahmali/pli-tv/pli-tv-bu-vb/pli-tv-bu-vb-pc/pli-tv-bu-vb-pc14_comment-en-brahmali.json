  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14:1.1.3": "Furniture” renders _senāsana_. _Senāsana_, literally “bed and seat”, refers broadly to any kind of “resting place”, ranging from huts ([](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.2)) to furniture ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14:1.1.5)) and bedding ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:1.5)), including even resting places at the foot of a tree ([](pli-tv-kd1:77.1.10)). It can also mean an individual resting place within a single dwelling ([](pli-tv-kd5:13.8.5)). This broad range of meaning is confirmed by the sub-commentary {Sp-ṭ.3.294}: _Catubbidhañhi senāsanaṃ vihārasenāsanaṃ mañcapīṭhasenāsanaṃ santhatasenāsanaṃ okāsasenāsananti. … Yattha vā pana bhikkhū paṭikkamanti, sabbametaṃ senāsananti_, “There are four kinds of _senāsana_: the dwelling _senāsana_, the bed-or-bench _senāsana_, the bedding (or “mat”) _senāsana_, the place _senāsana_. … Wherever monks retire to, all that is called _senāsana_.” It is almost impossible to capture this range of meaning in a single English word, with the possible exception of “resting place”. In practice, however, “resting place” is too vague to be properly meaningful. For this reason I vary my translation according to context, using “dwelling”, “furniture”, and “resting place” as appropriate.",

[](Sp.2.111): _Masārakoti mañcapāde vijjhitvā tattha aṭaniyo pavesetvā kato_, “_Masāraka_: it is made by making a hole in the legs of the bed and then inserting the rails of the frame there.” | _Bundikābaddha_. [](Sp.2.111): _Bundikābaddhoti aṭanīhi mañcapāde ḍaṃsāpetvā pallaṅkasaṅkhepena kato_, “_Bundikābaddha_: it is made by making the rails of the frame ‘biteʼ the legs of the bed, in the way of a luxurious bed (_pallaṅka_).” [](Sp-yoj.1.111): _Bundo eva bundiko, pādo, tasmiṃ ābaddhā bandhitā aṭanī yassāti bundikābaddho_, “_Bundikābaddha_: a _bundika_ is just a _bunda_, a leg; in that to which the rail is bound, attached.” | _Kuḷīrapādaka_.
