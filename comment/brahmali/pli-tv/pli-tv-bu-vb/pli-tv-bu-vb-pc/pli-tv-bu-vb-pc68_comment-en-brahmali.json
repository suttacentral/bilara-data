  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:2.1.53": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet elsewhere, such as _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10-13, it is said that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
