  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.6": "_Asambhinnena vilepanena_, an unusual expression. According to {Sp-ṭ.3.357}, _asambhinnena_ means “with [make-up] not smeared, not lost,” _amakkhitena, anaṭṭhena_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:7.1.8": "_Mattika_. I translate both _cuṇṇa_ and _mattika_ according to function rather than substance. _Cuṇṇa_ is powder used for a number of purposes, including medical ones, and _mattika_ is clay, but in this context both are used as cleaning agents. There are a number of Canonical passages that show them as the two principal agents for cleaning the body. At {MS.3.261} and a number of similar passages, we find that the two would always be made ready before entering the _jantāghara_, the sauna/bathroom. In the present rule, this very definition states that bathing includes the use of powder and/or clay. At {MS.4.2127–MS.3.2128} the nuns are prohibited from bathing with powder or scented clay, but should use ordinary clay instead. In the commentaries, at {Sp.3.33}, we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair: _Kesā panassa sayameva mattikaṃ gahetvā dhovitabbā._.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:7.1.21": ". Half a _yojana_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometers (see ACMC, p.16). Thus half a _yojana_ is just over 6 km."
