  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.2": "That is, four finger-breadths, _caturaṅgula_. 7 cm is based on the following conversion to metrical units. According to [Sp.1.348](): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.16": "That is, nine standard hand-spans (_sugata-vidatthi_) by six standard hand-spans. The metric measures given here are based on my own estimate of the _sugata-vidatthi_; see comment above. A robe size of 3.6 times 5.4 meters is unreasonably large and is the result of the commentarial explanation of the standard measures being three times those of normal people. It is likely, therefore, that the standard measures would have been smaller at a pre-commentarial point in Budddhist history. However, there are no other indications of the standard measures in the Pali text."
