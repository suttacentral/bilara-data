  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:1.16": "That is, nine standard hand-spans (_sugata-vidatthi_) by six standard hand-spans. The metric measures given here are based on my own estimate of the _sugata-vidatthi_; see comment at _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 6. A robe size of 3.6 times 5.4 meters is unreasonably large and is the result of the commentarial explanation of the standard measures being three times those of normal people. It is likely, therefore, that the standard measures would have been smaller at a pre-commentarial point in Budddhist history. However, there are no other indications of the standard measures in the Pali text."
