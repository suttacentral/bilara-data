  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc44:2.2.4": "The Pali reads _tiracchānagatāya vā manussaviggahitthiyā vā_, but it is not clear what _manussaviggahitthiyā_ would refer to in this context, and so I take this to be an editing mistake. I here follow the PTS reading, _tiracchānagatamanussaviggahitthiyā vā_, which makes better sense and is consistent with the following rule."
