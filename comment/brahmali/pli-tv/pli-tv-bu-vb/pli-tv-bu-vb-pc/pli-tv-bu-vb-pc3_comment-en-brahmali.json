According to [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.3.1) the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks.” [](Sp.2.37) supports the plural rendering “monks”: _Bhikkhūnaṃ pesuññe_, “Malicious talebearing of monks”.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.24": "I have added the ellipses points, which are presumably missing in the Pali due to an editing mistake, cf.[](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.22). The ellipses points are also missing at [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.26).",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.27": "This looks like an editing mistake. Presumably this should read, “We’re not going to a good destination/we can only expect a bad destination.”"
