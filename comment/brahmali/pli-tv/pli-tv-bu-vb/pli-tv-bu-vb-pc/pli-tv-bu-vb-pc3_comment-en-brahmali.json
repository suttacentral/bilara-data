According to [](MS.2.144) (see below) the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks.” [](Sp.2.37) supports the plural rendering “monks”: _Bhikkhūnaṃ pesuññe_, “Malicious talebearing of monks”.",
