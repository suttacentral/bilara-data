  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:2.1.30": "_Cuṇṇa_. See next note for why this is “bath powder”. | _Mattika_. I translate both _cuṇṇa_ and _mattika_ according to function rather than substance. _Cuṇṇa_ is powder used for a number of purposes, including medical ones, and _mattika_ is clay, but in this context both are used as cleaning agents. There are a number of Canonical passages that show them as the two principal agents for cleaning the body. At {MS.3.261} and a number of similar passages, we find that the two would always be made ready before entering the _jantāghara_, the sauna/bathroom. At _bhikkhu pācittiya_ 57 bathing is defined as bathing with powder and/or clay. At {MS.4.2127–MS.3.2128} the nuns are prohibited from bathing with powder or scented clay, but should use ordinary clay instead. In the commentaries, at {Sp.3.33}, we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair: _Kesā panassa sayameva mattikaṃ gahetvā dhovitabbā._."
