  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.1.44": "The English translation cannot properly capture the Pali, in which the word for “offense” and “attainment” is the same, _āpatti_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.2.23": "_Kilāsa_ is closely related to _kuṭṭha_. [Sp.3.88](): _Kilāsoti na bhijjanakaṃ na paggharaṇakaṃ padumapuṇḍarīkapattavaṇṇaṃ kuṭṭhaṃ_, “_Kilāsa_ is leprosy without lesions, without discharge, and with the color of red and white lotuses.” It seems modern medical science distinguishes between tuberculoid leprosy, which is mild and has few lesions, and lepromatous leprosy, which is severe and has widespread lesions. It seems plausible to identify _kilāsa_ with the former and _kuṭṭha_ with the latter. But to avoid the technical Latinate medical vocabulary, I render them respectively as “mild leprosy” and “leprosy”.",
