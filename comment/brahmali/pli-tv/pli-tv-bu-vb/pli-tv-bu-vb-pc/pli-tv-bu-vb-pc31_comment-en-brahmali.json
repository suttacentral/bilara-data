Gantvā paccāgacchantopi antarāmagge ekadivasaṃ āgataṭṭhāne ca ekadivasaṃ bhuñjituṃ labhati_, “Or going means: whoever is going, if he eats one day on the road and one day at the place he has gone to, there is no offense. The same method applies for one who is coming. After going, even when returning, he may eat one day on the road and one day at the place returned to.”"
