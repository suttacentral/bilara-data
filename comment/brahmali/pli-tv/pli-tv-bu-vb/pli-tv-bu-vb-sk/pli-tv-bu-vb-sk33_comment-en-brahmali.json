  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk33:1.13": "_Uttaribhaṅga_. According to [](Vin-vn-ṭ.1907) this is just another word for _byañjana_: _uttaribhaṅgaṃ nāma byañjanaṃ_. _Byañjana_ seems to refer to curries apart from the standard bean-curries, which are called _sūpa_. However, since _uttaribhaṅga_ is a rare word, the basic meaning of which is something like “further condiments,” it is quite possible that it is here meant to include all foods apart from bean-curries."
