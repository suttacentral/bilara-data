"pli-tv-bu-vb-np23:1.3.32": "“Tonics” renders _bhesajja_. The Pali word _bhesajja_ is broader than the English “medicine”. It includes certain foods that provide nourishment without being considered substantial. In most contexts this latter group concerns a standard set of five non-substantial foods: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and sugar. Occasionally it also refers to other edibles that are closer to food than medicine proper, such as fats (which are to be melted and mixed with oil) and in one case even rice porridge. I have called these “tonics”, following a precedent set by others, such as Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro. In other context _bhesajja_ is rendered as medicine, including cases when _bhesajja_ is used as an umbrella term for all of these substances."
