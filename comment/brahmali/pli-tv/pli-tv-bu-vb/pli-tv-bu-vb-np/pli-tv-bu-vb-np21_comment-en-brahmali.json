  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.4": "“Transferred” renders _vikappita_/_vikappanā_, sometimes translated as “shared ownership”. There is little evidence, however, for this latter rendering, and the Canon clearly supports the former. In the main rule that deals with _vikappanā_, _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 59, it is described as follows: “I give (_dammi_) this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of _vikappanā_” and “I give it to them (_dammi)”. And once the cloth has been transferred, it is called “their property” (_tesaṃ santakaṃ_). It is clear from this that _vikappanā_ refers to a change in ownership. This finding is reinforced by the usage of _vikappanā_ in _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 33. The Buddha tells Ven. Ānanda to _vikappeti_ a meal in the following way: “I give (_dammi_) my expected meal to so-and-so.” In the context of this rule _vikappeti_ can only mean “to transfer ownership”, not “to share ownership”. Sometimes _vikappanā_ is rendered simply as “transfer”. But since it only concerns a transfer of ownership, not necessarily a physical transfer, it could also be rendered “transfer of ownership”, although this latter expression is a bit clumsy in most contexts.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np21:3.13": "According to [Sp.1.463]() this means the tenth dawn after one received the bowl: _Cīvaruppādadivasaena saddhiṃ ekādase aruṇuggamane nissaggiyaṃ hotīti veditabbaṃ_, “It is to be understood in this way: it is to be relinquished on the eleventh dawn including the day when the robe (or bowl) was given.”"
