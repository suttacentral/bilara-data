  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:0.6": "Here, and in the heading to _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya 3_ (and also at the end of each of these rules), I translate _kathina_ as “robe-making season” rather than “robe-making ceremony”, since this is the contextual meaning in these rules.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.31": "In addition to meaning a finished robe, according to the definition of _cīvara_ below it also refers to pieces of robe-cloth. This means that I have to vary my translation depending on the context.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.2": "This refers to the robe-cloth received during the robe-making season. For details see [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37).",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.4": "For an explanation of this see [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.3) and [](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37).",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.8": "“Transferred” renders _vikappita_/_vikappanā_, sometimes translated as “shared ownership”. There is little evidence, however, for this latter rendering, and the Canon clearly supports the former. In the main rule that deals with _vikappanā_, _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 59, it is described as follows: “I give (_dammi_) this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of _vikappanā_” and “I give it to them (_dammi)”. And once the cloth has been transferred, it is called “their property” (_tesaṃ santakaṃ_). It is clear from this that _vikappanā_ refers to a change in ownership. This finding is reinforced by the usage of _vikappanā_ in _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 33. The Buddha tells Ven. Ānanda to _vikappeti_ a meal in the following way: “I give (_dammi_) my expected meal to so-and-so.” In the context of this rule _vikappeti_ can only mean “to transfer ownership”, not “to share ownership”. Sometimes _vikappanā_ is rendered simply as “transfer”. But since it only concerns a transfer of ownership, not necessarily a physical transfer, it could also be rendered “transfer of ownership”, although this latter expression is a bit clumsy in most contexts.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.10": "The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp, see [](pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6). | According to [](pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4) this is no smaller than 8 by 4 _sugataṅgula_, or 40 by 20 cm. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to [Sp.1.348](): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.2": "According to [Sp.1.462]() this means the tenth dawn after one received the robe(-cloth)."
