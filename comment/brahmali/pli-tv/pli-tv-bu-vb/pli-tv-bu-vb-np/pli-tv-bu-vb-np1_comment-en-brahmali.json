  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.31": "In addition to meaning a finished robe, according to the definition of _cīvara_ below it also refers to pieces of robe-cloth. This means that I have to vary my translation depending on the context.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.8": "“Transferred” is a rendering of _vikappita_. The explanation given at _pācittiya_ 59 seems to make it clear that _vikappanā_ refers to a change in ownership. The word commentary specifically says that the item is given to someone else and that the monk giving it up may use it only if he takes their belonging on trust.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.10": "The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp, see [](pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6). | According to [](pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4) this is no smaller than 8 by 4 _sugataṅgula_, or 40 by 20 cm. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to {Sp.1.348}: _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” Ajahn Thanissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, as Ajahn Thanissaro does in BMC I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a handpsan (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.2.2": "According to {Sp.1.462} this means the tenth dawn after one received the robe(-cloth)."
