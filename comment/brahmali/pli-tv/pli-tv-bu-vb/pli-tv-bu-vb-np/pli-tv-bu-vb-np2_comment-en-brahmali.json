Without this explanation it is hard to make out whether the arm’s reach is from the house or from the robe.

In fact [](Sp.1.482) says they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bare roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” (For why a _pāsāda_ is a stilt house, see [ref. to internet page].) For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [](MS.1.1901-MS.1.1904), the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.",
