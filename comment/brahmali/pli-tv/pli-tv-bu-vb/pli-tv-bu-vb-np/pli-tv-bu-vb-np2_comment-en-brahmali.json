  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.2.5": "I have here included three kinds of building—the _māḷa_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_—into one category, “stilt house.” See below for an explanation.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.2.6": "“Stilt house” renders _pāsāda_, often translated as “palace” or “mansion”. Apart from the phonetic similarity between _pāsāda_ and “palace”, which does not seem to have any linguistic significance, this is based mostly on the commentarial explanations. The Canonical texts, however, do not support these latter two renderings. To start with, _pāsādas_ were allowed by the Buddha for monastics. One of the main principles found in the Vinaya is that monastics should not live in luxury. On this basis alone we can conclude that _pāsādas_ were not generally luxurious. This immediately eliminates “palace” and “mansion” as suitable translations. Another thing that stands out about _pāsādas_ is that they are always ascended to and descended from. This means that they must have been relatively tall buildings. An interesting point is that the _suttas_ do not seem to mention any other way of accessing these buildings—apart from ascent/descent—which must mean that they were not directly accessible from ground level. They must have been built on some sort of high foundation. A passage at ([](sn3.21:5.1)) is particularly instructive: “Suppose, great king, a man would climb from the ground on to a palanquin, or from a palanquin on to horseback, or from horseback to an elephant mount, or from an elephant mount to a _pāsāda_ …” According to a number of passages, _pāsādas_ had external staircases (_sopānakaḷevara_, [](mn85:5.1)) or ladders (_nisseṇi_, [](dn9:37.1) and [](dn13:21.1)), including the _pāsāda_ given to the Sangha by Visākha ([](mn107:2.2)), and they were apparently always entered with the help of these. Similes in [](dn9:37.1) and [](dn13:21.1) speak of making the ladder before building a hypothetical _pāsāda_. These similes seem to imply that all _pāsādas_ were accessed by climbing. In addition, the use of the word “ladder” shows that _pāsādas_ often were quite humble buildings. The need for climbing to get access also seems to be why—in one of the case stories to _bhikkhu-pārājika_ two ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.3))—Ven. Pilindavaccha was able to make use of a _pāsāda_ to hide children from kidnappers. If _pāsādas_ were high off the ground and the access ladder was removed, then the children were presumably safe. We also find the fairly common compound _uparipāsāda_, “up the _pāsāda_”, which fits this description. No other names for types of buildings are compounded with _upari_ in this way. The final clue to the meaning of _pāsāda_ is that they seem to have had a space underneath. At [](an3.39:2.2), where the Buddha speaks of his life before going forth, it is said that he stayed in the rainy-season _pāsāda_ for the full four months of the rains, without _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohami_. _Orohati_ means “descends” and _heṭṭhā_ means “below”. _Heṭṭhā_ is used in other compounds such as _heṭṭhāmañcaṃ_ which unambiguously means “below the bed (_mañca_)”. It follows that _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati_ can only really mean “descends to below the _pāsāda_”, which must mean that _pāsādas_ had open spaces under them. The most obvious sort of building that fits with this is a stilt house.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1": "The building at [](pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1), the _māḷa_, is hard to distinguish from the next two buildings, the _pāsāda_ and the _hammiya_. In fact [](Sp.1.482) says they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bare roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [](pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.1-pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.5.4), the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.11.1": "According to [](Sp.1.489): _Ekaṃ abbhantaraṃ aṭṭhavīsatihatthaṃ hoti_, “One _ abbhantara_ is twenty-eight _hatthas_.” Following my own estimate of the _hattha_ as 40 centimeters, this gives 11.2 meters for one _abbhantara_ and about 80 meters for 7. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to [](Sp.1.348): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",
