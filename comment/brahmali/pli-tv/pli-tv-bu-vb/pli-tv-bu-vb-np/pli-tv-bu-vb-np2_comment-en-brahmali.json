  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1": "The building at [](MS.1.1906), the _māḷa_, is hard to distinguish from the buildings mentioned in the next two paragraphs, the _pāsāda_ and the _hammiya_. In fact [](Sp.1.482) says they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bare roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” (For why a _pāsāda_ is a stilt house, see [ref. to internet page].) For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [](MS.1.1901-MS.1.1904), the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.11.1": "According to {Sp.1.489}: _Ekaṃ abbhantaraṃ aṭṭhavīsatihatthaṃ hoti_, “One _ abbhantara_ is twenty-eight _hatthas_.” Following my own estimate of the _hattha_ as 40 centimeters, this gives 11.2 meters for one _abbhantara_ and about 80 meters for 7. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to {Sp.1.348}: _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” Ajahn Thanissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, as Ajahn Thanissaro does in BMC I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a handpsan (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",
