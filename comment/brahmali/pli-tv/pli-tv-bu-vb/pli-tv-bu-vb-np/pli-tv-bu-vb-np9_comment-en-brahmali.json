  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.39": "The only phrase in this rule that may be somewhat unclear is _ubhova santā ekena_, here translated as “put together.” It seems to me that this phrase needs to be related to the main sentence verb _acchādetha_, “present” or “give,” which takes the instrumental of the thing given: “present (him) with one (robe).” _Ubhova santā_ is explained below in the word commentary as _dvepi janā_, “both people,” and the overall phrase then becomes, “two people present (him) with one (robe).“ This means that the funds are put together, and I translate accordingly."
