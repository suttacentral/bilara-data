  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np29:2.7": "The text reads “five hundred bow lengths,” _pañcadhanusatikaṃ_. [](Sp-ṭ.2.92): _Ācariyadhanu nāma pakatihatthena navavidatthippamāṇaṃ, jiyāya pana āropitāya catuhatthappamāṇa_, “A measure of nine hand-spans of an ordinary hand, or a measure of four forearms when the bowstring is attached, this is called the Teacher’s bow length.” According to [](Sp.1.92) the teacher’s bow length is the standard measure for bow lengths: _Ācariyadhanunā pañcadhanusatappamāṇanti veditabbaṃ_, “A measure of five hundred bow-lengths is to be understood according to the Teacher’s bow length.” According to SED (s.v. _dhanu_), too, one bow length is equivalent to four _hatthas_ , or four forearm’s lengths. Given my estimate of 40 cm for one forearm (see _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 6), five hundred bow lengths add up to 800 meters."
