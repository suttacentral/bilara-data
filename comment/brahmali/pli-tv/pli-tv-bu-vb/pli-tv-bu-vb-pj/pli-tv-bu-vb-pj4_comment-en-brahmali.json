  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.12": "_Setughāta_, lit. “destroyed the bridge”. [Sp.1.16](): _Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṃ hoti_, “The path is called the bridge; such speech is destroyed by the path.” The commentary seems to take _setu_, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.17": "I have rendered _muñja_-reed and _pabbaja_-reed with the single word “reed.” I am not aware that these two kinds of reed can be distinguished in English.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:9.3.68": "“Robeˮ renders _saṅghāṭi_. A _saṅghāṭi_ is normally understood to refer to one of the three robes of a _bhikkhu_ or one of the five of a _bhikkhunī_. It can then be translated as “outer robe” to distinguish it from the _uttarasaṅga_ (“the upper robe”) and the _antaravāsaka_ (“the lower robe” or sarong). Upper robe is not, however, always a satisfactory rendering of _saṅghāṭi_, as can be seen from a number of different contexts in the Vinaya Piṭaka. There are in fact three different uses of the word, ranging in meaning from “robe” in general to “upper robe”—denoting either the _uttarasaṅga_, _saṅghāṭi_, or both—to “outer robe”, which is the only case when it specifically refers an individual robe. I thus translate _saṅghāṭi_ in three different ways, as either “robe”, “upper robe”, or “outer robe”. I use the context to decide which one is appropriate in each particular case.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:4.2.9": "“Of what is true” is not in the Pali, but has been added for clarity.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:4.5.63b": "I have added ellipses points before and after this segment. These ellipses points seem to have been omitted by mistake from the Pali.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:4.8.115": "Although two attainments are given in each case of the above permutation series, it seems that only the one which remains unchanged within each sub-section is considered the root item.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:5.1.1": "It seems to me that the lack of understanding refers to the speaker rather than the listener. _Bhaṇantassa_ (“for the one who is speaking”) and _paṭivijānantassa_ (“for the one who understands”) are more likely to refer to the same person than to different people. Moreover, the natural meaning of _na paṭivijānantassa āpatti thullaccayassa_ (III 97,30-31) is “there is an offense of _thullaccaya_ for one who does not recognize/understand”. Since the offense mentioned here refers to the person making the claim, this cannot refer to the listener.
  
  
  In agreement with [Sp.1.220](), I understand _paṭivijānantassa_ to refer to the listener rather than the speaker. Grammatically the word could refer to either (it can be regarded as a genitive agreeing with _bhaṇantassa_, thus referring to the speaker, or it can be regarded as a dative of the person spoken to, that is, the listener), but logically it seems it must refer to the listener. _Paṭivijānantassa_ refers to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, rather than knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:5.1.42": "The Pali text reads _vatthu_,“basisˮ, rather than _vattu_, “speech.ˮ However, I have chosen to follow the alternative reading of _vattu_—found in the PTS edition and at [Sp.1.215]()—since this seems more reasonable to me given the context.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:6.2.15": "Because _vihāra_, “dwelling”, is mentioned just before, I here render _senāsana_ as furniture.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:6.2.24": "The Pali has an additional set of ellipses points between “who has made use of your medicines” and “attained the fourth absorption in an empty dwelling”. This seems to be a mistake."
