  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.9": "I have here translated _kāya_ as breath in accordance with the usage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta [](mn118:24.6) where the breath is specifically said to be a body among bodies. This is also the explanation at [Sp.1.165](): _Sakalassa assāsakāyassa ādimajjhapariyosānaṃ viditaṃ karonto pākaṭaṃ karonto “assasissāmī”ti sikkhati_, “He trains, ‘I will breath in,’ producing knowledge of and familiarity with the beginning, the middle, and the end of the whole body of the breath.”",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.23.1": "The text doesn’t say what the legal procedure, the _saṅghakamma_, was about, but it seems implied that it was against that monk. This is also the position of the subcommentary at [](Sp-ṭ̣.2.187): _Kammādhippāyāti: tajjanīyādikammakaraṇādhippāyā_, “Aiming at a legal procedure: aiming at doing a legal procedure of censure, etc.” The monks from the group of seventeen were in regular conflict with the monks from the group of six."
