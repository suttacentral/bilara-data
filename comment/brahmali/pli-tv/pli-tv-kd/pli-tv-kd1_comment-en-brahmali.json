The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to {Sp.1.348}: _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",

In this case the measure of the season is just the season.

Alternatively, ‘this is the name of the season, and it is complete or incomplete (by so many days)’, in this way the date is to be pointed out. ‘It is morning or evening’, in this way the part of the day is to be pointed out.” I have followed the latter of these two ways of understanding these terms, see CPD. _Saṅgīti ācikkhitabbā_, literally, “A joint recitation is to be declared,” which is rather cryptic. {Sp.3.128}: _Saṅgītīti idameva sabbaṃ ekato katvā ‘tvaṃ kiṃ labhasi, kā te chāyā, kiṃ utuppamāṇaṃ, ko divasabhāgo’ti puṭṭho ‘idaṃ nāma labhāmi – vassaṃ vā hemantaṃ vā gimhaṃ vā, ayaṃ me chāyā, idaṃ utuppamāṇaṃ, ayaṃ divasabhāgoti vadeyyāsī’ti evaṃ ācikkhitabbaṃ_ “_Saṅgīti_: here it means: having brought everyone together, it should pointed out: “When you are asked, ‘What did you have? What time did you have?

Tattha ekato katvā ācikkhitabbaṃ. Tvaṃ kiṃ labhasīti tvaṃ upasampādanakāle kataravassaṃ, katarautuñca labhasi, katarasmiṃ te upasampadā laddhāti attho._ “‘Here’ etc. means: having collected all—that is the time, etc.—_saṅgīti_ is said because it is to be chanted, because it is to be declared. In regard to this, having brought (everyone) together, it is to be pointed out. ‘What did you have’ means: at the time of the ordination, which year did you have, which season; your ordination was obtained in which one?”",
  "pli-tv-kd1:77.1.13": "“Stilt house” renders _pāsāda_, often translated as “palace” or “mansion”. Apart from the phonetic similarity between _pāsāda_ and “palace”, which does not seem to have any linguistic significance, this is based mostly on the commentarial explanations. The Canonical texts, however, do not support these latter two renderings. To start with, _pāsādas_ were allowed by the Buddha for monastics. One of the main principles of the _Vinaya_ is that monastics should not live in luxury. On this basis alone we can conclude that _pāsādas_ were not generally luxurious. This immediately eliminates “palace” and “mansion” as suitable translations. Another thing that stands out about _pāsādas_ is that they are always ascended to and descended from. This means that they must have been relatively tall buildings. An interesting point is that the _suttas_ do not seem to mention any other way of accessing these buildings—apart from ascent/descent—which must mean that they were not directly accessible from ground level. They must have been built on some sort of high foundation. A passage at ([](sn3.21:5.1)) is particularly instructive: “Suppose, great king, a man would climb from the ground on to a palanquin, or from a palanquin on to horseback, or from horseback to an elephant mount, or from an elephant mount to a _pāsāda_ …” According to a number of passages, _pāsādas_ had external staircases (_sopānakaḷevara_, [](mn85:5.1)) or ladders (_nisseṇi_, [](dn9:37.1) and [](dn13:21.1)), including the _pāsāda_ given to the Sangha by Visākha ([](mn107:2.2)), and they were apparently always entered with the help of these. Similes in DN9 and DN13 speak of making the ladder before building a hypothetical _pāsāda_. These similes seem to imply that all _pāsādas_ were accessed by climbing. In addition, the use of the word “ladder” shows that _pāsādas_ often were quite humble buildings. The need for climbing to get access also seems to be why—in one of the case stories to _bhikkhu-pārājika_ two ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.3))—Ven. Pilindavaccha was able to make use of a _pāsāda_ to hide children from kidnappers. If _pāsādas_ were high off the ground and the access ladder was removed, then the children were presumably safe. We also find the fairly common compound _uparipāsāda_, “up the _pāsāda_”, which fits this description. No other names for types of buildings are compounded with _upari_ in this way. The final clue to the meaning of _pāsāda_ is that they seem to have had a space underneath. In the passage from AN 3.39 mentioned above, where the Buddha speaks of his life before going forth, it is said that he stayed in the rainy-season _pāsāda_ for the full four months of the rains, without _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati_. _Orohati_ means “descends” and _heṭṭhā_ means “below”. _Heṭṭhā_ is used in other compounds such as _heṭṭhāmañcaṃ_ which unambiguously means “below the bed (_mañca_)”. It follows that _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati_ can only really mean “descends to below the _pāsāda_”, which must mean that _pāsādas_ had open spaces under them. The most obvious sort of building that fits with this is a stilt house. | Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling,” and the _guha_, “a cave,” the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” Here is what the commentaries have to say. {Sp.4.294}: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṃ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” {Sp-ṭ.4.294} clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṃ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” {Sp.4.294} continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At {Sp-ṭ.2.74}, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. | The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries: _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṃsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a guhā made of rocks, a guhā made of wood, a guhā made of dirt”, {Sp.4.294}. And: _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṃ pabbatānaṃ antarā, ekasmiṃyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṃ mahāvivaraṃ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them)”, {Sp.ṭ.3.294}. In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory.",
