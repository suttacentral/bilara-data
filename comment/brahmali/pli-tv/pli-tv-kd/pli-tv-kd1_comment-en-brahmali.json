According to {Vmv.3.126} this phrase should be understood by means of this example: _Ayaṃ buddharakkhito āyasmato dhammarakkhitassa saddhivihārikabhūto upasampadāpekkho_, “This Buddharakkhita, who is seeking the full ordination, is the student of Venerable Dhammarakkhita.” I have followed this interpretation, and thus my translation “with Venerable so-and-so.”",

What time did you have?

Tattha ekato katvā ācikkhitabbaṃ.

In regard to this, having brought (everyone) together, it is to be pointed out. ‘What did you have’ means: at the time of the ordination, which year did you have, which season; your ordination was obtained in which one?”",
