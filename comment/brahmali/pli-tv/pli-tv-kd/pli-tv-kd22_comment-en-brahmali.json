  "pli-tv-kd22:1.10.13": "{Sp-ṭ.1} (p.42): _Siṅgena loṇaṃ pariharitvā pariharitvā aloṇakapiṇḍapātena saddhiṃ bhuñjituṃ kappati, na sannidhiṃ karotīti adhippāyo._ “Carrying salt in horn here and there, is it allowable to eat it together with unsalted almsfood? The meaning is one should not store it.”",
  "pli-tv-kd22:2.3.34": "_Āmāvuso, api ca mayaṃ garunissayaṃ gaṇhāmāti_. {Sp-ṭ.4.454}: _Garunissayaṃ gaṇhāmāti kiñcāpi mayaṃ mahallakā, etaṃ pana theraṃ garuṃ katvā vasissāmāti adhippāyo_, “_Garunissayaṃ gaṇhāma_: although I am a senior monk, I will dwell respecting this senior monk.” | {Vmv.4.454} adds: _Garunissayaṃ gaṇhāmāti nissayamuttāpi mayaṃ ekaṃ sambhāvanīyagaruṃ nissayabhūtaṃ gahetvāva vasissāmāti adhippāyo_, “_Garunissayaṃ gaṇhāma_: even though I no longer need support, I will live supported by one who is to be respected.”",

  "pli-tv-kd22:2.5.5": "_Kullakavihārena_. {Sp.4.455}: _Kullakavihārenāti uttānavihārena_, “_Kullakavihāra_ means a straightforward meditation.” This, however, seems like a put-down, which does not fit the context well. It seems more likely to me that _kullaka_ is instead related to Sanskrit _kulya_, “of a good/noble family.”",
