  "pli-tv-kd11:2.1.5": "_Adesanāgāminiya_. {Sp.4.4}: _Adesanāgāminiyāti pārājikāpattiyā vā saṅghādisesāpattiyā vā_, “‘Not clearable by confession’ means an offense entailing expulsion or an offense entailing suspension.”",
  "pli-tv-kd11:5.1.13": "_Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ_. {Sp.4.76} says: _Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbanti aññamaññaṃ yojetvā kalaho na kāretabbo_, “_Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṃ_ means they should not quarrel when they associate with each other.”",
  "pli-tv-kd11:5.1.16": "_Na anuvādo paṭṭhapetabbo_. {Vmv.4.428}: _Anuvādaṃ paṭṭhapentīti issariyaṃ pavattentīti atthaṃ vadanti_, “_Anuvādaṃ paṭṭhapenti_ means they set authority in motion, which means they speak of the matter.”",
  "pli-tv-kd11:6.1.2": "“Conducted themselves properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vattanti, lomaṃ pātenti, netthāraṃ vattanti_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult. Commenting on _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 13, {Sp.1.435} explains the negative version of these phrases thus: _Na lomaṃ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṃ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṃ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṃ na paṭipajjanti._, “_Na lomaṃ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṃ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.",
  "pli-tv-kd11:9.1.3": "_Apissu bhikkhū pakatā parivāsaṃ dentā …_. {Sp.3.11}: _apissu bhikkhū pakatāti apissu bhikkhū niccaṃ byāvaṭā honti_, “_Apissu bhikkhū pakatā_: moreover, the monks were regularly busy.”",
  "pli-tv-kd11:16.1.28": "The MS text reads, _tena hi, bhikkhave, saṃgho pabbājanīyakammaṃ paṭippassambhetu_, “Well then, monks, lift that procedure of banishment,” which must be an error. I here follow the text as found in the PTS edition, _tena hi, bhikkhave, saṃgho pabbājanīyakammaṃ na paṭippassambhetu_.",
  "pli-tv-kd11:18.3.7": "According to the commentary this is an insult. Citta had a relative who was a baker, a low class occupation. By asking for sesame cookies, Sudhamma was apparently trying to remind Citta of his low class relative, thereby insulting him.",
  "pli-tv-kd11:34.1.16": "All versions of the Pali available to me have this reading, which presumably is wrong. The expected reading is that the _saṅghakamma_ should *not* be lifted. Ariṭṭha has returned to lay life. To lift the _saṅghakamma_ done against him would only be possible if he were still a monk. Moreover, even if he were a monk, he would have to give up his view before the _saṅghakamma_ could be lifted."
