It includes certain foods that provide nourishment without being considered substantial. In most contexts this latter group concerns a standard set of five non-substantial foods: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and sugar. Occasionally it also refers to other edibles that are closer to food than medicine proper, such as fats (which are to be melted and mixed with oil) and in one case even rice porridge. I have called these “tonics”, following a precedent set by others, such as Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro.

In the commentaries, at [Sp.3.33](), we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair: _Kesā panassa sayameva mattikaṃ gahetvā dhovitabbā._ | _Rajananippakka_, literally, “Dye that has been cooked”.

My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm (_hattha_) measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅguli_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅguli_) of 5 cm. | _Vatthikamma_.
