  "pli-tv-kd16:1.2.16": "Apart from _vihāra_, “dwellings,” and _guha_, “caves,” the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt houses.” Here is what the commentaries have to say. {Sp.4.294}: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṃ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” {Sp-ṭ.4.294} clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṃ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” {Sp.4.294} continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At {Sp-ṭ.2.74}, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.11": "“Lower and upper hinges” renders _udukkhalika_ and _uttarapāsaka_, respectively. {Sp.1.77}: … _yena kenaci kavāṭaṃ katvā heṭṭhā udukkhale upari uttarapāsake ca pavesetvā kataṃ parivattakadvārameva saṃvaritabbaṃ … atha dvārassa udukkhalaṃ vā uttarapāsako vā bhinno vā hoti aṭṭhapito vā, saṃvarituṃ na sakkoti_, “Having made a door by whatever (material), having entered it into the _udukkhala_ below and into the _uttarapāsaka_ above, it is made a revolving door to be closed … but when the _udukkhala_ or the _uttarapāsaka_ is broken or not mounted, then one cannot close the door.” From this it seems that the _udukkhala_ and _uttarapāsaka_, together with the two corresponding “projecting pivots” on the door, are the functional equivalents of hinges. _Udukkhalika_ and _udukkhala_ refer to the same thing, the former being used in the canonical text, whereas the latter is found in the summary verses. For further details see CPD under _uttarapāsaka_.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.12": "_Kavāṭā na phusīyanti_. Elsewhere we have the expression _phusitaggaḷa_, “with a touching door,” to describe a well-built house, e.g. at MN 12. The same description says that the house is _nivāta_, “free from draught.” {MA.1.154} comments: _phusitaggaḷanti dvārabāhāhi saddhiṃ supihitakavāṭaṃ_, “With a touching door: the door-panel closes well with the door frame.” The point seems to be that the door is closed all the way so that it touches the door frame.",

  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.15": "_Kavāṭā na thakiyanti_. The commentaries are silent. Under the entry _thaketi_, DOP says: “covers, covers up; closes”. The context, however, suggests that this concerns more than merely closing the door, which is already effected by the hole and the rope mentioned just above. That more than closing is meant is also apparent from the fact that the remedy is to allow the use of bolts.",

It is where three or four holes are made for inserting bolts.” Whenever the Canonical text lists the parts of a door and door frame, the _aggaḷavaṭṭi_ always has the same position, being grouped together with the parts for the locking mechanism, such as bolts. It thus seems reasonable to think that this was a special post added to the door frame for the purpose of receiving bolts. | _Kapisīsaka_. {Sp.4.260}: _Kapisīsakaṃ nāma dvārabāhaṃ vijjhitvā tattha pavesito aggaḷapāsako vuccati_. “The bolt-receiving socket which is inserted after piercing the door post is called a _kapisīsaka_.” | _Sūcika_. {Sp.4.260}: _Sūcikāti tattha majjhe chiddaṃ katvā pavesitā_, “It is entered, having made a hole in the middle there.” | _Ghaṭika_. {Sp-ṭ.4.255}: _Ghaṭikanti upari yojitaṃ aggaḷaṃ_, “_Ghaṭika_: a bolt fastened at the top.” From the origin story to _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 2 (MS.1.994) is seems that the _ghaṭika_ was the name of a lockable bolt: _avāpuraṇaṃ ādāya ghaṭikaṃ ugghāṭetvā kavāṭaṃ paṇāmetvā vihāraṃ pāvisi_, “(Udāyī) took the key, unlocked the bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling.”",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.18": "The point seems to be that they were somehow able to fasten the internal bolts from the outside, but not to unfasten them.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.25": "_Yantaka_ and _sūcika_. A _yantaka_ seems to be any implement that is used as bolt, whereas a _sūcika_ is a bolt proper. {Sp.4.296}: _Yantakaṃ sūcikanti ettha yaṃ yaṃ jānāti taṃ taṃ yantakaṃ, tassa vivaraṇasūcikañca kātuṃ vaṭṭati_ “Here, whatever he finds, that is a _yantaka_; to make an bolt for opening of it is allowed.”",

This makes it certain that _ogumphetvā_ in the present context must refer to the “firming up” rather than the “shaking out.”",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.2.8": "_Vedikāvātapāna_. {Sp.4.296}: _Vedikāvātapānaṃ nāma cetiye vedikāsadisaṃ._ “(A window) like the railing on a shrine is called _vedikāvātapāna_.” | _Salākavātapāna_. {Sp.4.296}: _Salākavātapānaṃ nāma thambhakavātapānaṃ_ “Windows with rods are called _salākavātapāna_.”",

  "pli-tv-kd16:2.2.14": "_Vātapānakavāṭaka_ and _vātapānabhisika_. I am not able to make a meaningful distinction between the two. _Vātapānakavāṭaka_, literally means “a small door for the windows.” The _vātapānabhisika_ is described at {Sp.4.296}: _Vātapānabhisīti vātapānappamāṇena bhisiṃ katvā bandhituṃ anujānāmīti attho_. “_Vātapānabhisi_: the meaning is: ‘I allow, having made a small mattress the size of the window, to bind it on’.”",

  "pli-tv-kd16:2.3.12": "_Sosānika_. {Vin-vn-ṭ.663} says: _Sosānikanti susāne chaḍḍitaṃ_, “_Sosānika_ means what is discarded on a charnel ground.” | The text gives two different kinds of beds (and benches just below) called _masāraka_ and _bundikābaddha_. The only difference between the two seems to be how the rails are fastened to the legs. From this it seems reasonable to conclude that all beds with legs and a frame are allowable, as long as they adhere the the other standards of the Vinaya, such as _pācittiya_ 87. Thus my decision to group these beds and benches together as “various kinds of beds/benches”. The commentaries have this to say about the nature of these beds and benches: {Sp.2.111}: _Masārakoti mañcapāde vijjhitvā tattha aṭaniyo pavesetvā kato. Bundikābaddhoti aṭanīhi mañcapāde ḍaṃsāpetvā pallaṅkasaṅkhepena kato_, “_Masāraka_: it is made by making a hole in the legs of the bed and then inserting the rails of the frame there. _Bundikābaddha_: it is made by making the rails of the frame ‘bite’ the legs of the bed, in the way of a luxurious bed (_pallaṅka_).” {Sp-yoj.1.111} adds: _Bundo eva bundiko, pādo, tasmiṃ ābaddhā bandhitā aṭanī yassāti bundikābaddho_, “_Bundikābaddho_: a _bundika_ is just a _bunda_, a leg; in that to which the rail is bound, attached.”",
