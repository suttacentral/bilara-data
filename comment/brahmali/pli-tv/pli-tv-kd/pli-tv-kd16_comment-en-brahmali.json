  "pli-tv-kd16:1.2.15": "_Leṇa_. [](Sp-ṭ.5.294): _Pañca leṇānīti pañca līyanaṭṭhānāni. Nilīyanti ettha bhikkhūti leṇāni_; “The five _leṇas_: the five places for resting. _Leṇas_ are where monks hide away.”",
  "pli-tv-kd16:1.2.16": "“Stilt house” renders _pāsāda_, often translated as “palace” or “mansion”. Apart from the phonetic similarity between _pāsāda_ and “palace”, which does not seem to have any linguistic significance, this is based mostly on the commentarial explanations. The Canonical texts, however, do not support these latter two renderings. To start with, _pāsādas_ were allowed by the Buddha for monastics. One of the main principles found in the Vinaya is that monastics should not live in luxury. On this basis alone we can conclude that _pāsādas_ were not generally luxurious. This immediately eliminates “palace” and “mansion” as suitable translations. Another thing that stands out about _pāsādas_ is that they are always ascended to and descended from. This means that they must have been relatively tall buildings. An interesting point is that the _suttas_ do not seem to mention any other way of accessing these buildings—apart from ascent/descent—which must mean that they were not directly accessible from ground level. They must have been built on some sort of high foundation. A passage at ([](sn3.21:5.1)) is particularly instructive: “Suppose, great king, a man would climb from the ground on to a palanquin, or from a palanquin on to horseback, or from horseback to an elephant mount, or from an elephant mount to a _pāsāda_ …” According to a number of passages, _pāsādas_ had external staircases (_sopānakaḷevara_, [](mn85:5.1)) or ladders (_nisseṇi_, [](dn9:37.1) and [](dn13:21.1)), including the _pāsāda_ given to the Sangha by Visākha ([](mn107:2.2)), and they were apparently always entered with the help of these. Similes in [](dn9:37.1) and [](dn13:21.1) speak of making the ladder before building a hypothetical _pāsāda_. These similes seem to imply that all _pāsādas_ were accessed by climbing. In addition, the use of the word “ladder” shows that _pāsādas_ often were quite humble buildings. The need for climbing to get access also seems to be why—in one of the case stories to _bhikkhu-pārājika_ two ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.3))—Ven. Pilindavaccha was able to make use of a _pāsāda_ to hide children from kidnappers. If _pāsādas_ were high off the ground and the access ladder was removed, then the children were presumably safe. We also find the fairly common compound _uparipāsāda_, “up the _pāsāda_”, which fits this description. No other names for types of buildings are compounded with _upari_ in this way. The final clue to the meaning of _pāsāda_ is that they seem to have had a space underneath. At [](an3.39:2.2), where the Buddha speaks of his life before going forth, it is said that he stayed in the rainy-season _pāsāda_ for the full four months of the rains, without _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohami_. _Orohati_ means “descends” and _heṭṭhā_ means “below”. _Heṭṭhā_ is used in other compounds such as _heṭṭhāmañcaṃ_ which unambiguously means “below the bed (_mañca_)”. It follows that _heṭṭhāpāsādaṃ orohati_ can only really mean “descends to below the _pāsāda_”, which must mean that _pāsādas_ had open spaces under them. The most obvious sort of building that fits with this is a stilt house. | Apart from _vihāra_, “dwellings,” and _guha_, “caves,” the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt houses.” Here is what the commentaries have to say. [](Sp.4.294): _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṃ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” [](Sp-ṭ.4.294) clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṃ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” [](Sp.4.294) continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At [](Sp-ṭ.2.74), however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. | The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries: _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṃsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a guhā made of rocks, a guhā made of wood, a guhā made of dirt”, [](Sp.4.294). And: _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṃ pabbatānaṃ antarā, ekasmiṃyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṃ mahāvivaraṃ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them)”, [](Sp.ṭ.3.294). In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.11": "“Door frame” renders _piṭṭhasaṅghāṭa_. The precise meaning of the two words that make up this compound is never clarified in the Pali texts, but it seems clear enough that the compound as a whole refers to the entire door frame, for instance when it is used to define the _dvārakosa_ at _bhikkhu-pācitttiya_ 19. [](Vmv.1.349): Piṭṭhasaṅghāṭo nāma dvārabāhasaṅkhāto caturassadārusaṅghāṭo, yattha sauttarapāsaṃ kavāṭaṃ apassāya dvāraṃ pidahanti, “Piṭṭhasaṅghāṭo: a rectangular binding together of wood, called a doorcase, where the door with its hinges are supported and shut the doorway.” | “Lower and upper hinges” renders _udukkhalika_ and _uttarapāsaka_, respectively. [](Sp.1.77): … _yena kenaci kavāṭaṃ katvā heṭṭhā udukkhale upari uttarapāsake ca pavesetvā kataṃ parivattakadvārameva saṃvaritabbaṃ … atha dvārassa udukkhalaṃ vā uttarapāsako vā bhinno vā hoti aṭṭhapito vā, saṃvarituṃ na sakkoti_, “Having made a door by whatever (material), having entered it into the _udukkhala_ below and into the _uttarapāsaka_ above, it is made a revolving door to be closed … but when the _udukkhala_ or the _uttarapāsaka_ is broken or not mounted, then one cannot close the door.” From this it seems that the _udukkhala_ and _uttarapāsaka_, together with the two corresponding “projecting pivots” on the door, are the functional equivalents of hinges. _Udukkhalika_ and _udukkhala_ refer to the same thing, the former being used in the canonical text, whereas the latter is found in the summary verses. For further details see CPD under _uttarapāsaka_.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.12": "_Kavāṭā na phusīyanti_. Elsewhere we have the expression _phusitaggaḷa_, “with a touching door,” to describe a well-built house, e.g. at [](mn12:41.4). The same description says that the house is _nivāta_, “free from draught.” [MN-a.1.154]() comments: _phusitaggaḷanti dvārabāhāhi saddhiṃ supihitakavāṭaṃ_, “With a touching door: the door-panel closes well with the door frame.” The point seems to be that the door is closed all the way so that it touches the door frame.",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.14": "“A hole … for pulling it” and “a rope for pulling it” render _āviñchanachidda_ and _āviñchanarajju_ respectively.

  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.15": "_Kavāṭā na thakiyanti_. The commentaries are silent. Under the entry _thaketi_, DOP says: “covers, covers up; closes”. The context, however, suggests that this concerns more than merely closing the door, which is already effected by the hole and the rope mentioned just above. That more than closing is meant is also apparent from the fact that the remedy is to allow the use of bolts.",

It is where three or four holes are made for inserting bolts.” Whenever the Canonical text lists the parts of a door and door frame, the _aggaḷavaṭṭi_ always has the same position, being grouped together with the parts for the locking mechanism, such as bolts. Given the commentarial explanation, it is natural to think that it was a special post added to the door frame for the purpose of receiving bolts. | _Kapisīsaka_. [](Sp.4.260): _Kapisīsakaṃ nāma dvārabāhaṃ vijjhitvā tattha pavesito aggaḷapāsako vuccati_. “The bolt-receiving socket which is inserted after piercing the door post is called a _kapisīsaka_.” | _Sūcika_.

This makes it certain that _ogumphetvā_ in the present context must refer to the “firming up” rather than the “shaking out.”",

The only difference between the two seems to be how the rails are fastened to the legs. From this it seems reasonable to conclude that all beds with legs and a frame are allowable, as long as they adhere the the other standards of the Vinaya, such as _pācittiya_ 87. Thus my decision to group these beds and benches together as “various kinds of beds/benches”. The commentaries have this to say about the nature of these beds and benches: [](Sp.2.111): _Masārakoti mañcapāde vijjhitvā tattha aṭaniyo pavesetvā kato. Bundikābaddhoti aṭanīhi mañcapāde ḍaṃsāpetvā pallaṅkasaṅkhepena kato_, “_Masāraka_: it is made by making a hole in the legs of the bed and then inserting the rails of the frame there. _Bundikābaddha_: it is made by making the rails of the frame ‘bite’ the legs of the bed, in the way of a luxurious bed (_pallaṅka_).” [](Sp-yoj.1.111) adds: _Bundo eva bundiko, pādo, tasmiṃ ābaddhā bandhitā aṭanī yassāti bundikābaddho_, “_Bundikābaddho_: a _bundika_ is just a _bunda_, a leg; in that to which the rail is bound, attached.”",

I take this to be equivalent to the maximum height allowed under _bhikkhu pācittiya_ 87, where the _aṅgula_ is specified as the _sugataṅgula_, “the standard finger-breadth”. 40 centimeters is based on my calculation of the _sugataṅgula_ as 5 cm. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to [](Sp.1.348): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",

In some contexts this may be roughly appropriate, but _sālā_ is in fact used much more broadly than “hall”. At the lower end of the spectrum it refers to small buildings, probably no more than sheds, for instance the _aggisālā_ (“a water-boiling shed”), the _udapānasāla_ (“a well-house”), and the _pānīyasālā_ (“a drinking-water shed”). Buildings that were presumably intermediate in size, were also called _sālā_, such as the _kathinasālā_ (“a sewing shed”), the _jantāgharasālā_ (“a sauna shed”), and the _āpaṇasālā_ (“a shop”). _Sālā_ includes buildings that would have been quite substantial, including the _upaṭṭhānasālā_ (“an assembly hall”). The Canon also mentions the _kūṭāgārasālā_ (“the peaked house _sālā_”) and the fact that wealthy people had _mahāsālās_ (“large _sālās_”). In addition to this, _sālā_ covers large but simple buildings, such as _caṅkamasālā_ (“an indoor walking path”), _gosālā_ (“a cow shed”), _assasālā_ (“a horse stables”), and _hatthisālā_ (“an elephant stables”). Apart from the issue of size, there is no indication that a _sālā_ had to consist of a single room, as implied by the rendering “hall”. Another piece of evidence is found at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 31, where the _sālā_ as a venue for eating is contrasted with the _maṇḍapa_ (“a roof-cover”) and open air venues (_rukkhamūla_ and _ajjhokāsa_). In this last instance _sālā_ seems to be a generic reference to an indoor venue, perhaps best rendered as “building”. Given this diversity in usage, it seems _sālā_, in its generic sense, may best be rendered as “bulding”. In more particular instances, such as here, it seems best to render it according to context.",

That it is not an indoor area can be seen from the present context where a _pariveṇa_ is said to get muddy, upon which the Buddha allows gravel, stepping stones, and drains. The _pariveṇa_ is often mentioned in connection with keeping a building tidy, specifically as an area that is to be swept ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.6)). It seems natural to conclude that this must refer to the area, or part of it, that surrounds a building. This is confirmed by the commentaries. [](Sp.ṭ.3.117): _Pariveṇanti ekekassa vihārassa parikkhepabbhantaraṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: 11 meters surrounding each individual dwelling.” Sometimes, but not always it seems, this area would be walled in. [](Sp.ṭ.2.103): _Pariveṇanti mahāvihārassa abbhantare visuṃ visuṃ pākāraparicchinnaṭṭhānaṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: a separate place delimited by a wall within a large monastery.” This fits with the fact that _pariveṇas_ are said to be constructed ([](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.9)), as well as the frequent mention in the Vinaya Piṭaka of _koṭṭhakas_, “gateways”. Gateways would make no sense without a surrounding wall. On a more general note, the term _pariveṇa_ is not found in the four main Nikāyas, and in the Vinaya Piṭaka it is found only in narratives, minor rules on conduct, and explanatory material. This suggests it may not have existed in the earliest period of Buddhist monasticism. The earliest buildings and monasteries would have been simple, without much embelishment, especially the surrounding walls.",

Occasionally _aggisālā_ can also refer to a “fire hut”, as used by ascetics who tended the sacred fire. The latter half of the word, _sālā_, is etymologically related to the English word “hall” and is often translated as such.
