According to [](Sp.1.348): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.",

Given the commentarial explanation, it is natural to think that it was a special post added to the door frame for the purpose of receiving bolts. | _Kapisīsaka_. [](Sp.4.260): _Kapisīsakaṃ nāma dvārabāhaṃ vijjhitvā tattha pavesito aggaḷapāsako vuccati_. “The bolt-receiving socket which is inserted after piercing the door post is called a _kapisīsaka_.” | _Sūcika_. [](Sp.4.260): _Sūcikāti tattha majjhe chiddaṃ katvā pavesitā_, “It is entered, having made a hole in the middle there.” | _Ghaṭika_. [](Sp-ṭ.4.255): _Ghaṭikanti upari yojitaṃ aggaḷaṃ_, “_Ghaṭika_: a bolt fastened at the top.” From the origin story to _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 2 (MS.1.994) is seems that the _ghaṭika_ was the name of a lockable bolt: _avāpuraṇaṃ ādāya ghaṭikaṃ ugghāṭetvā kavāṭaṃ paṇāmetvā vihāraṃ pāvisi_, “(Udāyī) took the key, unlocked the bolt, opened the door, and entered the dwelling.” | _Āviñchanachidda_. [](Vmv.4.296): _Āviñchanachiddanti yattha aṅguliṃ vā rajjusaṅkhalikādiṃ vā pavesetvā kavāṭaṃ ākaḍḍhantā dvārabāhaṃ phusāpenti_, “_Āviñchanachidda_: where, having entered the finger or a rope or a chain, etc. they pull the door and make it touch the door post.” | _Āviñchanarajju_. [](Sp.4.296): _Āviñchanarajjunti kavāṭeyeva chiddaṃ katvā tattha pavesetvā yena rajjukena kaḍḍhantā dvāraṃ phusāpenti_, “Having made a hole in the door, having entered (the rope) there, the rope with which they close and make the door touch (the post).”",
  "pli-tv-kd15:14.3.14": "_Maṇḍalika_. [](Sp.4.260): _Maṇḍalikaṃ kātunti nīcavatthukaṃ cinituṃ_, “To make a _maṇḍalika_ means to construct a low site.” [](Sp-ṭ.4.260) specifies: _Nīcavatthukaṃ cinitunti bahikuṭṭassa samantato nīcavatthukaṃ katvā cinituṃ_, “_Nīcavatthukaṃ cinituṃ_ means to construct after making the ground low on all sides outside the wall.”",
  "pli-tv-kd15:14.5.1": "“Precincts” renders _pariveṇa_, sometimes rendered as “cell”, for which there is no proper basis. The _pariveṇa_ is the area surrounding a building. That it is not an indoor area can be seen from the present context where a _pariveṇa_ is said to get muddy, upon which the Buddha allows gravel, paving stones, and drains. The _pariveṇa_ is often mentioned in connection with keeping a building tidy, specifically as an area that is to be swept ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.6)). It seems natural to conclude that this must refer to the area, or part of it, that surrounds a building. This is confirmed by the commentaries. [](Sp.ṭ.3.117): _Pariveṇanti ekekassa vihārassa parikkhepabbhantaraṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: 11 meters surrounding each individual dwelling.” Sometimes, but not always it seems, this area would be walled in. [](Sp.ṭ.2.103}: _Pariveṇanti mahāvihārassa abbhantare visuṃ visuṃ pākāraparicchinnaṭṭhānaṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: a separate place delimited by a wall within a large monastery.” This fits with the fact that _pariveṇas_ are said to be constructed ([](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.9)), as well as the frequent mention in the Vinaya Piṭaka of _koṭṭhakas_, “gateways”. Gateways would make no sense without a surrounding wall. On a more general note, the term _pariveṇa_ is not found in the four main Nikāyas, and in the Vinaya Piṭaka it is found only in narratives, minor rules on conduct, and explanatory material. This suggests it may not have existed in the earliest period of Buddhist monasticism. The earliest buildings and monasteries would have been simple, without much embellishment, especially the surrounding walls.",

  "pli-tv-kd15:16.1.6": "“Sauna shed” renders _jantāgharasālā_. It seems from the above description of a sauna that it was a building, including a roof. A _jantāgharasālā_ is then presumably another building (from the description below it seems to a separate building from the sauna) where you get undressed and hang up your robes, etc. “Water-boiling shed” renders _aggisālā_. _Sālā_ is etymologically related to the English word “hall” and is often translated as such. In some contexts this may be roughly appropriate, but _sālā_ is in fact used much more broadly than “hall”. At the lower end of the spectrum it refers to small buildings, probably no more than sheds, for instance the _aggisālā_ (“a water-boiling shed”), the _udapānasāla_ (“a well-house”), and the _pānīyasālā_ (“a drinking-water shed”). Buildings that were presumably intermediate in size, were also called _sālā_, such as the _kathinasālā_ (“a sewing shed”), the _jantāgharasālā_ (“a sauna shed”), and the _āpaṇasālā_ (“a shop”). _Sālā_ includes buildings that would have been quite substantial, including the _upaṭṭhānasālā_ (“an assembly hall”). The Canon also mentions the _kūṭāgārasālā_ (“the peaked house _sālā_”) and the fact that wealthy people had _mahāsālās_ (“large _sālās_”). In addition to this, _sālā_ covers large but simple buildings, such as _caṅkamasālā_ (“an indoor walking path”), _gosālā_ (“a cow shed”), _assasālā_ (“a horse stables”), and _hatthisālā_ (“an elephant stables”). Apart from the issue of size, there is no indication that a _sālā_ had to consist of a single room, as implied by the rendering “hall”. Another piece of evidence is found at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 31, where the _sālā_ as a venue for eating is contrasted with the _maṇḍapa_ (“a roof-cover”) and open air venues (_rukkhamūla_ and _ajjhokāsa_). In this last instance _sālā_ seems to be a generic reference to an indoor venue, perhaps best rendered as “building”. Given this diversity in usage, it seems _sālā_, in its generic sense, may best be rendered as “bulding”. In more particular instances, such as here, it seems best to render it according to context.",
