  "pli-tv-kd10:2.6.8": "_Viññutaṃ pāpuṇi_, literally, “reached discernment.” Commenting on a similar context in the _Bhikkhunī-kkhandhaka_, {Sp.4.432} explains: _Yāva so dārako viññutaṃ pāpuṇātīti yāva khādituṃ bhuñjituṃ nahāyituñca maṇḍituñca attano dhammatāya sakkotīti attho_, “_Yāva so dārako viññutaṃ pāpuṇāti_ means until he is able to eat, bathe, and groom himself.”",
