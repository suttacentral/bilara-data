  "pli-tv-kd3:1.3.4": "_Vassaṃ upagantuṃ_, literally, “To enter the rainy season,” but the idea of staying put in one place is implied. In these cases _vassa_, “rainy season”, is used synonymously with _vassāvāsa_, “rainy-season residence” or “rains residence”.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:2.2.6": "Although the match is not precise, I have here translated Āsāḷha as July.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:4.3.4": "_Rājūnaṃ anuvattituṃ_, literally, “(You should) behave according to the kings.” This is often understood to mean that monastics are obliged to follow the laws of the land in which they live.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.2.6": "The Pali word translated here as “give” is _patiṭṭhāpetu_, which normally means “establish.” In the present context I understand it as “establishing a gift”, in the sense that the gift is meant for the Sangha but given in the presence of the local monks. The expression _dakkhiṇaṃ patiṭṭhāpeti_, “to establish a gift,” is quite common in the _suttas_, see {SN.3.19}, {AN.4.61}, {AN.5.41}, {AN.5.227}, and {AN.6.37}.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.5.5": "As elsewhere, I have rendered _aḍḍhayoga_, _pāsāda_, and _hammiya_ together a “stilt house.” According to the commentaries, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house.” Here is what the commentaries have to say. {Sp.4.294}: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṃ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” {Sp-ṭ.4.294} clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṃ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” {Sp.4.294} continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At {Sp-ṭ.2.74}, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8": "_Guhā_. The exact meaning of this word is disputed, and I am not aware of any unambiguous definition in Pali sources. In Sanskrit, however, an attested meaning of _guhā_ is “cave” or “hiding place”.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.5.12": "_Aggisālā_. For the meaning of this word see {Sp.2.112} and {Sp-yoj.1.112}. _Sālā_ is often rendered as “hall”, but in some context, such as here, a humble structure is clearly intended. In fact _sālā_ seems to be a generic term for a building.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.9.8": "According to {MS.1.1906}, the _māḷa_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_ are all different kinds of stilt houses. It is hard to make a meaningful distinction between these buildings from a modern perspective, and I have there grouped them together into the single category of stilt house. See {Sp.1.482} for further details.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.12.19": "According to {MS.1.1906}, the _māḷa_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_ are all different kinds of stilt houses. It is hard to make a meaningful distinction between these buildings from a modern perspective, and I have there grouped them together into the single category of stilt house. See {Sp.1.482} for further details.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:6.11.4": "“Conducts himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vattati, lomaṃ pāteti, netthāraṃ vattati_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult. Commenting on _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 13, {Sp.1.435} explains: _Na lomaṃ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṃ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṃ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṃ na paṭipajjanti._, “_Na lomaṃ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṃ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:6.25.4": "_Vassaṃ pucchitukāmo_. _Vassa_ could here refer to rains/rainy season or to the year, i.e. the age of the novice, perhaps to find out out whether he is eligible for ordination. The commentaries are silent.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:7.8.2": "“One who is staying with monks” renders _bhikkhugatika_. {Sp.3.275}: _Bhikkhugatikoti ekasmiṃ vihāre bhikkhūhi saddhiṃ vasanakapuriso_, “_Bhikkhugatika_ means a man living with the monks in a particular monastery.”",
  "pli-tv-kd3:12.9.1": "_Cāṭi_. {Sp.3.204}: _Cāṭiyāti etthāpi mahantena kapallena_, “Here _cāṭi_ is a large bowl.”"
