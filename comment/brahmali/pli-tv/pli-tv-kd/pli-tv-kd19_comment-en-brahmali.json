He commits wrong conduct. Thus, for him who has an offense, the Monastic Code is canceled.” [](Vmv.4.387) adds: _Dhammikaṃ sāmagginti dhammikaṃ samaggakammaṃ_ “_Dhammikaṃ sāmaggiṃ_ means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent. In such a case you are allowed to cancel their hearing of the Monastic Code. | _Dhammikaṃ sāmaggiṃ paccādiyati_.
