  "pli-tv-kd18:4.1.30": "“Dining hall” renders _bhattagga_, literally “eating house”. The name suggests that the _bhattagga_ was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries ([](pli-tv-kd10:4.5.7)). Since they were part of houses, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the _bhattagga_, except in monasteries. This is supported by a passage in _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 3 ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.1)) that mentions a cooking implement, a pestle, being stored in a _bhattagga_.",
  "pli-tv-kd18:5.2.25": "_Ṭhapeti_. [](Sp-ṭ.3.366) says: _Ṭhapeti vāti ‘‘tiṭṭhatha, bhante’’ti vadantī ṭhapeti nāma_, “_Ṭhapeti vā_: saying, ‘Wait, Venerable Sir,’ is called _ṭhapeti vā_.”",

[](Vin-ālaṅ-ṭ.1.190): _aggi upaṭṭhāpetabbotiādi vāḷamigasarīsapādibāhiraparissayakāle ca vātapittādiajjhattapaassayakāle ca icchitabbattā_ “_Aggi upaṭṭhāpetabbo_ etc, means what is required at a time of danger outside from wild animals, snakes, and centipedes, and at a time of refuge indoors due to wind, bile, and other illnesses.” The point seems to be that they should have access to fire.",
  "pli-tv-kd18:7.4.16": "_Yena vuḍḍho tena parivattitabbaṃ_. [](Sp.4.369) says: _Yena vuḍḍho tena parivattitabbanti vuḍḍhābhimukhena parivattitabbaṃ_, “_Yena vuḍḍho tena parivattitabbaṃ_ means he should turn around facing the more senior monk.” [](Sp-yoj.3.370) adds: _Parivattitabbanti parimukhaṃ vattitabbaṃ_, “_Parivattitabba_ means he should go while facing him.”",
  "pli-tv-kd18:7.4.18": "“Sauna” renders _jantāghara_. The Buddha’s personal physician, Jīvaka, recommended a _janṭāghara_ for the Sangha to keep the monks healthy ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.1.8)). The _jantāghara_ was a room with a fire place and a flue ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.16)). It was used to make one sweat ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.31)) and was also a place for cleaning oneself ([](pli-tv-kd1:25.12.4)). Moreover, the verb for what one does in a _jantāghara_ is “bathe”, _nahāyati_ ([]( pli-tv-kd20:27.4.15)). All in all it comes very close to what we now call a sauna.",
  "pli-tv-kd18:10.3.24": "“Area outside” is a rendering of _paribhaṇḍa_. [](Sp.4.371) says: _Paribhaṇḍanti bahijagati_, “_Paribhaṇḍa_ means the earth outside.”",
  "pli-tv-kd18:11.4.6": "That is, four _aṅgula_. This is based on my calculation of the _aṅgula_, “the fingerbreadth”, as 1.67 cm. The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to [](Sp.1.348): _Sugatavidatthi nāma idāni majjhimassa purisassa tisso vidatthiyo_, “Now the _sugata vidatthi_ is equal to three _vidatthis_ of an average man.” In The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro understands _sugata_ here to refer to the Buddha, and thus concludes that the Buddha is three times the size of an ordinary man, which he rightly finds hard to accept. My understanding, however, is that _sugata_ in these contexts refers to standard measures. In their 2018 translation of the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī (p.145, note 4), Norman et.al. state that “_sugata_ is used as an adjective in combination with various measures, and means ‘current’.” These “current” measures would then have become the standard measures used by the Saṅgha, and I translate accordingly. Further, according to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm, which gives a hand-span (_vidatthi_) of 20 cm, and a finger-breadth (_aṅgula_) of 1.67 cm. If the standard (_sugata_) measures are three times ordinary measures, we get a standard hand-span (_sugatavidatthi_) of 60 cm, and a standard finger-breadth (_sugataṅgula_) of 5 cm.", 
  "pli-tv-kd18:11.16.4": "“Conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vatteyya, lomaṃ pāteyya, netthāraṃ vatteyya_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult. Commenting on _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 13, [](Sp.1.435) explains: _Na lomaṃ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṃ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṃ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṃ na paṭipajjanti._, “_Na lomaṃ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṃ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.",
