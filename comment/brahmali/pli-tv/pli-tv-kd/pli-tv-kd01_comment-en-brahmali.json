  "pli-tv-kd1:76.1.1": "_Gaṇḍa_, literally, “a swelling”. _Gaṇḍa_ is commonly translated as “boils”, yet a boil is often just a superficial skin disease without much swelling. “Abscess” seems closer to the mark. _Kilāsa_ is closely related to _kuṭṭha_. {Sp.3.88} says: _Kilāsoti na bhijjanakaṃ na paggharaṇakaṃ padumapuṇḍarīkapattavaṇṇaṃ kuṭṭhaṃ_, “_Kilāsa_ is leprosy without lesions, without discharge, and with the color of red and white lotuses.” It seems modern medical science distinguishes between tuberculoid leprosy, which is mild and has few lesions, and lepromatous leprosy, which is severe and has widespread lesions. It seems plausible to identify _kilāsa_ with the former and _kuṭṭha_ with the latter.

According to {Vmv.3.126} this phrase should be understood by means of this example: _Ayaṃ buddharakkhito āyasmato dhammarakkhitassa saddhivihārikabhūto upasampadāpekkho_, “This Buddharakkhita, who is seeking the full ordination, is the student of Venerable Dhammarakkhita.” I have followed this interpretation, and thus my translation “with Venerable so-and-so.”",

What time did you have? What date did you have?’ you should reply, ‘I had this: it was the rainy season/the cold season/the hot season; I had this time; I had this date.’” The point seems to be that a newly ordained monk should remember the time and date of his ordination so that he may respond to questions about it in future. {Vmv.3.128} clarifies: _Chāyādikameva sabbaṃ saṅgahetvā gāyitabbato kathetabbato saṅgītīti āha ‘idamevā’tiādi.
