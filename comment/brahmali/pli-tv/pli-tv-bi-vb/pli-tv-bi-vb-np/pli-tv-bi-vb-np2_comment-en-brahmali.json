See {Kkh.} | According to the commentary to _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya_ 3, “designated” means designated as out-of-season cloth or designated to an individual: _Kālepi ādissa dinnanti saṅghassa vā “idaṃ akālacīvara”nti uddisitvā dinnaṃ, ekapuggalassa vā “idaṃ tuyhaṃ dammī”ti dinnaṃ,_ “‘Also, if it is given in the robe season, but it is designated’ means: it is given to the Order after designating it by saying, ‘This is out-of-season robe-cloth’, or it is given to an individual by saying, ‘I give this to you’.” The commentary to the present rule adds that designating to a group is included in designated cloth: _Ādissa dinnanti sampattā bhājentūti vatvāpi idaṃ gaṇassa idaṃ tumhākaṃ dammīti vatvā vā dātukamyatāya pādamūle ṭhapetvā vā dinnampi ādissa dinnaṃ nāma hoti; etaṃ sabbampi akālacīvaraṃ;_ “‘Given after designating’ means: if they give after saying, ‘Let those who are present share it out,’ or after saying, ‘I give this to the group, to you,’ or they place it at the feet (of the recipient) wishing to give, this is called ‘Given after designating’. All this is called out-of-season robe-cloth.” | See {Kkh.}",
