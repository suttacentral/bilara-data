For further explanation, see comment at _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 6. As for the meaning of _vikappanā_, here translated as “transfer,” the explanation given at _pācittiya_ 59 seems to make it clear that it refers to a change in ownership. The word commentary specifically says that the item is given to someone else and that the monk giving it up may use it only if he takes their belonging on trust."
