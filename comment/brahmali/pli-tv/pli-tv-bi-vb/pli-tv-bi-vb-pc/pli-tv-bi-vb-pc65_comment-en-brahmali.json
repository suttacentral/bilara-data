  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65:2.1.8": "_Gihigatā nāma purisantaragatā vuccati._ The meaning of _gihigatā_ is by no means obvious. I take it to mean “one who has gone to a layman,” that is, someone who is married. The subcommentary, {Vin-vn-ṭ.2365}, glosses _purisantaragatā_ as _purisasamāgamappatta_, “One who has attained cohabitation with a man.”",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65:2.1.12": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such a _bhikkhu saṅghādisesa_ 10, {MS.1.1694}, the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
