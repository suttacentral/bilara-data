  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:1.14": "It is often understood that a woman needs permission from both her parents and her husband to ordain as a _bhikkhunī_ Yet the rule uses the conjunction _vā_, which can only reasonably be rendered as “or”.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:2.1.16": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such a _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
