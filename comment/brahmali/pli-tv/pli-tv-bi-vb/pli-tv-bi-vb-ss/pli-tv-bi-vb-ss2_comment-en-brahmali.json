  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.11": "_Jānāhi_, literally, “You know.” The implied meaning is not clear. However, in commenting on a different passage, one of the sub-commentaries defines the word as follows: “And here the meaning of ‘you know’ is to be understood as ‘you undertake’.” (_Jānāhīti cettha paṭipajjāti attho veditabbo._ ({Sp-ṭ̣.3.330}))",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.30": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such a _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
