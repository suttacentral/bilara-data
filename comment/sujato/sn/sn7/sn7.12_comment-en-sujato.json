  "sn7.12:1.4": "As BB notes, dutiyampi here must mean the next day, so why not translate it thus?",
  "sn7.12:1.6": "To trace pakatthaka, as PTS dict and BB do, to Skt prakṛṣ in the sense “disturb” seems unnecessary, and conflicts with the commentary. Surely we are better adopting the PTS dicts suggestion to associate this with kaṭṭha2 “bad, useless”, but more specifically, empty, pithless, like a reed or bamboo (see katthaka). While BB and PTS both mention the Skt prakarṣaka here in the sense of “harasser, disquieter”, this is in fact a name of the god of love, and so fits well with the idea of someone whose appetites are unquenchable. This then agrees with the Comm, rasagiddha.",
  "sn7.12:4.3": "BB uses these in their normal sense here, “weary and tremble”. However, when they occur together, as at SN 24.6, SN 42.23, and so on, they apply to criminal deeds, which I have rendered “oppress and intimidate”. BB has the same in that context. This fits here, as it is the kamma that immediately precedes the “fool” getting reborn."
