  "sn21.1:2.8": "The tenses here and in the parallel passages at SN 40.1ff are confused. Comparing the case here and in the recapitulation after the Buddha’s advice we have (in PTS and MS, incl variants): Before: vihariṁ or viharāmi After: vihāsiṁ or viharāmi BB ignores the differences, translating as “dwelt” in all cases. It seems to me that it makes more sense to think of the “before” case as a “historical present”, as in the standard “was staying at …” for viharati. The sense of the “before” case then conveys more of an ongoing process, a development. The “after” case, in aorist, then has a “perfect” sense."
