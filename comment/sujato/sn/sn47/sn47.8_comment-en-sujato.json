  "sn47.8:1.1": "nanaccaya is not entirely satisfactory. BB has no note. Woodward says: “Nānā-ccayehi (not accayehi) = nānā-sayehi, nānā-vidhehi. Comy.” However Comy as VRI has: “Nānaccayehīti nānācayehi, nānāvidhehīti attho. Ayameva vā pāṭho.” I don’t understand where the double cc comes from; and why use such an obscure word where there are much better known terms? SA 616 has no comparable terms. I think what is happening here is similar to the procedure for tooth woods described in the commentary for Kd1. A student is to supply the teacher with different lengths of tooth woods, notice which the teacher uses, then provide only them. This makes more sense to me in the current context; otherwise what’s the point? if they’re just going to offer every kind of curry every day, who cares which the master uses? Thus I suspect we should, in fact, read nana-accaya in the sense of “too many kinds”. The cook is to observe which the master likes, and only offer them.",
  "sn47.8:1.2": "the switch from -agga to no -agga is curious here. BB doesn’t represent this, probably taking it to be a mere verbal distinction. Woodward has “soups to be classified as …” following comms “-kotthasa”; but he includes all within this. I find “kotthasa” an unsatisfactory gloss. Thanissaro distinguishes them, using “mainly” for “agga”; again I find it unpersuasive. While most of these terms don’t occur elsewhere, madhuragga appears twice. In a stock phrase in the Sagathavagga we have Kodhassa visamūlassa, madhuraggassa “anger’s poisoned root and honeyed tip”. In Ja 511 we have, in the context of a mango of surpassing deliciousness, “Ambaṃ yassa phalaṃ sādu, madhuraggaṃ manoramaṃ”. In both these contexts the “point” (see what I did there?) is the deliciousness of the sweet flavor. And I think the two halves of the list are meant to complement each other. Sour curries may be hot or mild, salty or bland, and so on. Thus the difference is not merely verbal."
