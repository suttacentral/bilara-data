  "sn47.9:3.1": "BB has “shade behind the dwelling”, evidently accepting PTS’s vihārapacchāchāyāyaṃ. However vihārapacchāyāyaṃ occurs in several other similar contexts, without variants that I know of. The Buddha would regularly receive visitors there, so it meant something more than just the dwelling’s shade; it must have been a covered area outside the hut, i.e. a porch.",
  "sn47.9:3.3": "See BB’s note. I accept his suggestion that here we have the rare use of diṭthā in the sense of “fantastic”, see DN 26 and Ja 81. No doubt the rareness of this term is responsible for the variants.",
