  "sn2.23:8.2": "I’m not sure why BB has “had gifts given” here; diyittha is aorist passive, not causative. Lit: “of that me gift was given …”",
  "sn2.23:8.10": "BB has “returned” for patikkamati, which I think misses the point. I’m not clear what’s it’s meant to mean, either. patikkamati is used in two main senses: to return, and to dwindle. In the latter sense it’s found in the stock passage on the reduction of suffering for one who is ill. The point here is that as the king assigned his gates one by one for others to give, his own giving diminished until he had to send gifts outside the town.",
  "sn2.23:12.4": "I’m not clear whether this means “give half of that half “or” give that half”."
