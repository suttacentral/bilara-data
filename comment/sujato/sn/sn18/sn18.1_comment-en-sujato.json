  "sn18.1:4.1": "In this and similar passages, the handling of abbreviations in MS seems to be incorrect. When dealing with extended sets of phenomena associated with the ayatana, ellipsis is required. Here, however, the text deals only with the interior ayatanas—eye, ear, nose, etc. So there seems to be no call for ellipsis, and the practice is inherited incorrectly. Nevertheless, as it doesn’t affect the meaning, I don’t change the text."
