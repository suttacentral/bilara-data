  "sn8.10:1.2": "BB has “searched their minds”, but citta is singular. This is not uncommon. But usually samannesati is used when trying to find something. The monks were all arahants, but Moggallana did not know this, so he was checking them out.",
  "sn8.10:5.3": "i don’t accept BB’s amendation here. It seems to me the verse makes perfect sense as it stands, if we understand anga to refer to magganga; or perhaps more generally to a specific set of factors (bojjhanga, perhaps). In this sense, without violating the EBT’s anti-metaphysical understanding of Buddhahood, the Buddha can accurately be described as possessing “all” factors, but can only be said to possess “many” qualities or attributes (because some kinds of qualities are impossible or contradictory)"
