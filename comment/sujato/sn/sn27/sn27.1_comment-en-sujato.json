  "sn27.1:1.9": "BB notes the difficulty with khayati, but doesn’t explain how he gets from “seems “to” becomes”. The root is, however, khā, i.e. to speak, declare, and i take it as equivalent to pannayati. regarding kammaniya, see the similar passage at AN 5.68, etc, where bhabba is used. Kammaniya must have a similar sense."
