  "sn12.66:1.7": "sammasa is an unusual term in the suttas. the root is mas, to touch or rub. I’m reminded of the medical idea of self examination, touching or rubbing your body to see if there’s a lump or pain, etc.",
  "sn12.66:9.10": "This simile is reminiscent of the Garden of Eden.",
  "sn12.66:13.9": "Reading ahitaya dukkhaya, following PTS and BB. As for Bhatthalonika/matthalonika, I have no idea what it means. The only meaning I can extract from the dicts is mattha=brains. Which, okay, “salted brain” might be tasty, but i’m not sure this is what it means. Comm says Bhaṭṭhaloṇikāyāti saloṇena sattupānīyena. But I also have no idea what this means. upaniya is to infer, bring it. Is satta “beings=meat”? Then this would be meat broth as opposed to grain broth for lonasoviraka? Maybe! Either way, i find BB’s “porridge” just a bit humorous; I can’t image a thirsty man drinking porridge! Lacking a solution, the simile works fine with just three drinks."
