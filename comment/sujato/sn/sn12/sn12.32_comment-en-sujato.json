  "sn12.32:8.5": "Reading with PTS and BB khinasmim khimam iti. This phrase closely parallels the common idiom Vimuttasmiṃ vimuttamiti ñāṇaṃ hoti, and I think it should be translated in a similar way, rather than in line with the comm, as BB does.",
  "sn12.32:14.9": "anussavanti appears to be the only occurrence of this verb. Vll include -senti and anusav-. CPD suggests to overpower = anvāssavati. It notes SN 35.244, but there the variant anuseti should be preferred. DEP has “flows in”. PED prefers reading anuseti. BB has “flows in” but this is overly literal. If we accept the reading, it is merely a verb form of the noun."
