  "sn23.12:1.3": "BB has “subject to Māra”. In this context, it’s a tempting rendering. But as usual, I simply don’t think that’s what it means. It doesn’t mean, “Things over which Mara wields power”. It means “things that share a similar quality or nature to Mara”. My rendering is clumsy, but I think it captures the sense better."
