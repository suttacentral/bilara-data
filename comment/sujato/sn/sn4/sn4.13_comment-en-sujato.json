  "sn4.13:2.1": "It’s funny that Mara, who so often speaks in verse, seems to think that “drunk on poetry” means literally drunk. Is it possible that an echo of the old vedic tradition of taking intoxicants(soma) so that the god speaks through you is found in this phrase?",
  "sn4.13:2.2": "sampacura and pacura in relation to attha occur at AN 7.64, AN 4.53, AN 4.55, AN 5.148. The sense is clarified at AN 5.148 where it is the result of generosity, i.e. if you give, then later on you will not go without. This sense makes sense in all contexts, so should be translated accordingly."
