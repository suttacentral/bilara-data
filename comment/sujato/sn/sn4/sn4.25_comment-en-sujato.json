  "sn4.25:1.2": "Amending Arati to Rati, following the argument in Marcus Bingenheimer, Studies in Āgama Literature 4.5.",
  "sn4.25:2.2": "I don’t want to read a gay subtext into this, but there’s totally a gay subtext. Mara’s fascination with the Buddha was more than professional; he was practically a stalker.",
  "sn4.25:11.1": "The final vā here is unwarranted, cp. similar passages at AN 11.6, AN 5.190, etc.",
  "sn4.25:16.2": "See BB’s note; the Skt texts here have present tense. Even before i realized this I couldn’t make sense of this pada and assumed there must be some such corruption. Note that the change could come about simply by dropping one “t”: Pañcoghatiṇṇo (t)atarīdha chaṭṭhaṃ. I translate assuming present tense is correct.",
  "sn4.25:16.4": "aladdha here = pwned",
  "sn4.25:17.2": "asankharano is unusual in this context, and this is a guess. I suspect it means not living the holy life aspiring for rebirth in the deva realms.",
  "sn4.25:20.2": "See BB for tarissanti.",
  "sn4.25:24.1": "I find this metaphor hard to understand. The verse bears some resemblance to SN 36.4, where the patala is said to be under the ocean. I assume it means you’re trying to swim with a rock on your head!"
