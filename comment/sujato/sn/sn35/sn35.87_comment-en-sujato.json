  "sn35.87:11.2": "niccakappa is an unusual idiom, found only in this context and in MN 36. There it refers to the meditation that the Buddha returns to when he is done teaching. So it can’t mean literally “constantly”, it must be something more like the niccabhatta, a regular meal. But what is the force of kappa? i suspect it retains something of the sense of “appropriate, suitable”, and the phrase as a whole means “as regular as suitable”, i.e. “whenever you can, as often as possible”.",
