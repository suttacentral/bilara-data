  "sn35.61:1.1": "Upadana has the dual meanings of “grasping “and” fuel”. Normally, grasping predominates. here, however, as shown in SN 12.52, etc, fuel is the dominant metaphor. BB has “exhaustion of all clinging”, which is an incoherent metaphor. See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-grasping-and-fuel/2983"
