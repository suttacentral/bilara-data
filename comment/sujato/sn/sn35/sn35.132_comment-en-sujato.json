  "sn35.132:6.3": "BB has “hypocrisy, bent staffs”, but surely they must be taken together. For all their faults, it seems improbable that they actually upheld hypocrisy as an honorable practice! At Wat Pa Pong, Ajahn Chah used to laugh at those monks who imitated him by carrying a walking stick. Maybe the youths were doing something similar, or it could have been just a general thing. carrying a staff gave an impression of age. Of course, later it became a standard thing for brahmanical ascetics.",
