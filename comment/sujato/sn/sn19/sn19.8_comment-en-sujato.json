  "sn19.8:1.4": "See BB’s note for variants. I find it hard to accept that a horse trainer should be included here among what are obviously unskillful activities.

It seems he was some kind of herald, proclaiming the king’s deeds as he drove into battle. However, in SA 513 a 調象 “elephant trainer” is mentioned."
