  "sn14.12:2.2": "BB has “intention” for sankappa here, but this must be wrong. Intention doesn’t give rise to desire, rather it’s the other way around. the point being made here is that when you, say, see something arousing, you perceive it as such, and think about. the more your mind dwells on it, desire arises, which then gives rise to the search, which is where the intention to get something comes in."
