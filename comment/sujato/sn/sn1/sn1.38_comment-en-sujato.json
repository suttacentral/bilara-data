  "sn1.38:1.3": "BB has “stone splinter”, but in fact sakalika usually refers to wood. In his notes BB draws the connection between this passage Devadatta’s assault in Kd 17, and this where the “stone” comes from. However the texts don’t make it explicit that this is the same event. There, the splinter is referred to as papatikā, not sakalika, there is no mention of maddakucchi, nor is there a mention that the Buddha was seriously injured. In fact, in the next passage he’s walking for alms in Rajagaha. None of this shows that they were different events, but they do question whether we can rely on it as a fact. There is nothing implausible about the idea that the Buddha might have been injured twice. Anyway, I feel it’s better to avoid specifying “stone”, which is not demanded by the text.",
  "sn1.38:2.4": "BB discusses several possible ways to construe this phrase, none of which I find particularly compelling. I translate according to the apparent sense.",
  "sn1.38:6.2": "BB uses the traditional rendering of dhorayha as “beast of burden”. But this doesn’t sound very nice in English. The main connotation is not that they are struggling under their load, but that they are powerful, (it’s paired with balasampanno). Behemoth, I think, works reasonably well."
