  "sn1.20:20.1": "The obvious reading here is akkhati= express, as followed by comm and BB. However, there seems a tenuous connection with the previous passages. the Chinese parallels here don’t support “expressible”, although what they do say is unclear. SA 1078 has 愛想, perhaps from icchati, iṭṭhasañña? it also has 知所愛者 “one who desires the knowable ( jñeya)”. SA2.17 has 識於名色 “perceiving name and form”. I suspect that an original used a term related to akkhi/ikkhati which became confused. The Chinese terms don’t make this interpretation certain, but they are certainly closer than “the sayable”.",
