  "sn16.8:6.2": "BB follows comm in translating as “keen on the company of his brothers in the holy life”. (Sabrahmacārikāmoti ‘‘ime maṃ parivāretvā carantū’’ti evaṃ kāmeti) But it seems to me that the sense of the text doesn’t require such expansion. The point is that they’re trying to butter him up so he’ll share his stuff."
