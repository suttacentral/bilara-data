  "sn3.21:7.1": "The last phrase doesn’t mirror the positive version of the simile. BB has “enters an underground darkness”; maybe, but the text doesn’t say underground; and anyway, wouldn’t that be to “descend” once more?",
  "sn3.21:15.5": "BB’s “triple heaven” is misleading. This is just an abbreviated form of tavatimsa, i.e. the heaven of the Thirty Three (gods). (Historically, it would be more accurate to say that the Thirty Three is an expansion of the three.)"
