  "sn3.11:2.1": "See PTS dict under khari for vividha=vivadha=kāja.",
  "sn3.11:3.2": "I follow the PTS reading of the parallel passage at Ud 6.2. Otherwise this implicates Pasenadi in making a direct lie to the Buddha. Of course this is possible, but following the principle of least meaning it is preferable to assume that here, as usual, Pasenadi is acting in good faith.",
  "sn3.11:7.1": "See BB’s notes on readings. The use of ascetics for spies is recommended by the Aryhasastra, and is still alive and well today, being a standard technique under Communism."
