  "sn3.13:3.3": "Not sure that vedana here means ’ailments'as per BB; compare the stock passage on reflecting on food, where it clearly means the discomfort of overeating.",
  "sn3.13:4.3": "bhattabhihara means “offering a meal”, not “taking a meal”.",
  "sn3.13:4.4": "niccabhikkha is a curious idiom, not, so far as I know, discussed in any available dictionary. In Ja 398 it refers to the daily offering of food to a yakkha, and this must be the early meaning. here and at MN 94 it is explicitly said to refer to money, so this must have evolved. the fact that there Udena has to ask what kind of offering it is shows that it still might have meant food.",
  "sn3.13:6.2": "Interesting use of sallikhati = sallekha, here “cut down” ='slimmed', and related to the idea of “effacing” writing as the stone wears away. This also pertains to the (presumably) Jain use, to wear away the defilements (by austerities)"
