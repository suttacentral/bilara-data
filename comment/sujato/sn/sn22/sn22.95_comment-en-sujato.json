  "sn22.95:5.1": "Reading akukkuccajata. Here is my note on the corresponding passage at AN 9.196: BB has “without a fruit-bud core” for akukkuccakajāta. It’s not supported by comm or CPD. Evidently he’s following the comm for SN 22.95, where it refers to a banana tree. But I don’t even know what structure “fruit-bud core” refers to. There are multiple readings in the various contexts, but given that it follows ujum navam, I think it’s safe to assume that it’s meant to be the same word. I think it’s also safe to assume it doesn’t refer to any specific botanical structure, as these are very different trees. Most likely the term is a pseudo-synonym of uju and nava, and this fits the etymology of akukkucca, “not-ill-made”."
