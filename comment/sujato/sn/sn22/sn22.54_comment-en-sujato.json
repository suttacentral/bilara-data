  "sn22.54:1.2": "Bijajata are not “kinds of seeds “but” plants grown from seeds”. https://suttacentral.net/pi/pi-tv-bu-vb-pc11 Bhūtagāmo nāma pañca bījajātāni. Similarly, mulabija is not “root-seeds “but” plants grown from roots”, eg ginger, turmeric, etc. BB refers to the Vinaya passage that makes this clear. However he follows the comm for SN, which says bījajātānīti bījāni. This contradicts the Vinaya comm, which says: bījehi jātāni bījajātāni; rukkhādīnametaṃ adhivacanaṃ",
  "sn22.54:1.5": "sukhasayita doesn’t means “well-planted” as per BB; for how could it be planted if there is no soil? It means “well-laid by”, i.e. well kept or well preserved, as BB has in AN 3.34"
