  "sn22.3:1.5": "The line and it’s metaphorical interpretation work on two levels. The oka and niketa are the same basic meaning, but I have translated in line with the underlying etymology: oka from “place of comfort, shelter”, niketa as “heaping, settlement”. Sari means “wander, roam, drift”. Here it has a literal meaning, a homeless wanderer. But later one is said to be a “okasari” “house-wanderer”. How does this make sense? The root -sari is the same as the root for samsara, and so an okasari is one who wanders in samsara. Compare the standard simile for the dibbacakkhu, where a person walks out of one home down the street, and into another. Cf the modern idiom “couch-surfer”. I use the same term as i use for samsara to bring out this connection.sc2",
  "sn22.3:14.3": "Sahita as a quality of dhamma talks is found at AN 4.139 and AN 8.16. The basic meaning is “unified, together”. It is the same as the Vedic “samhita”. To me, “consistent” is more of a logical property, whereas what I think this means is “to the point, on topic.” Also note that PTS dict for this says reading avicinna is to be preferred. Under vicinna it says adhicinna is preferred. Handy."
