  "sn22.82:4.2": "It looks like a sadhu passage has been elided here. Indeed, in the parallel at MN 109, this sadhu passage is omitted, and so are the ones following, while here, only this one is omitted.",
  "sn22.82:5.5": "MS question mark here is incorrect.",
  "sn22.82:6.1": "BB’s “in what way” is not quite right here. kittavata means “to what extent” and is used to define or delineate. The question is whether there’s anything outside the khandhas.",
  "sn22.82:12.2": "Here and in the parallel passage at MN 108, BB omits the bho, without comment. Thanissaro does likewise. However it appears in both cases, without variants. In fact the idiom iti kira is invariably followed by a vocative, so it can’t be a mistake. Horner translates it in MN 108, with the note: “This looks like a case where a monk, in thought, applies bho to himself. Or else he is thinking (as translated at K.S. iii. 88) “so then you say.” ”",
  "sn22.82:13.4": "Once again, BB translates tatra tatra as “here and there”, though it is barely intelligible. Clearly here, as usual, a strongly distributive sense is required.",
  "sn22.82:15.1": "This is very unusual, a sutta-uddana."
