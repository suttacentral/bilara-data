  "sn56.39:4.1": "BB has “indra’s pillar” for indakhila, which is unjustified. there’s nowhere in the canon that supports an association between this pillar and the god Indra (who, in any case, is rarely called by that name in the pali). rather, the normal meaning of inda is “lord, soverign”, i.e. “one who exercises power”. Consistently, the term indakhila does not denote a religious icon, but the extent of temporal power: the threshold of a king’s chamber, or more commonly, the boundary between a village and the wilderness. The term “boundary pillar” captures this fairly well."
