  "sn55.21:1.4": "BB has “congested thouroughfares’ for sbadhabyuha, which, admittedly, makes more sense. However, byuha is only defined at one place in the canon, bi-vb-pc14: Byūhaṃ nāma yeneva pavisanti teneva nikkhamanti.” Byuha means, you come out the same way you go in “. BB says the comm explanation suggests byuha means a main road.” Sambādhabyūhanti byūhā vuccanti avinibbiddharacchāyo, yā paviṭṭhamaggeneva niggacchanti, tā sambādhā byūhā bahukā etthāti sambādhabyūhaṃ. “I’ll have to take his word for that, because I don’t know what” avinibbiddharacchāyo “means. Still,” yā paviṭṭhamaggeneva niggacchanti'is clearly referring back to the Vinaya definition, which suggests we should take it in the same meaning.",
  "sn55.21:3.2": "The parallel for this simile at SN 42.6 omits visesagami, and BB omits it here as well.",
  "sn55.21:3.6": "BB omits this sentence."
