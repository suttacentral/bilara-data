  "sn11.22:2.7": "BB treats this line as if spoken by Sakka. MS treats it as concluding the deva’s speech. In this case, MS is correct. When addressing the gods collectively, Sakka uses the plural mārisā (SN 11.3, SN 11.4, SN 11.14, SN 35.248). In addition, the idiom “So hi nūna”, so far as I can tell, always occurs at the start of a new speaker’s statement."
