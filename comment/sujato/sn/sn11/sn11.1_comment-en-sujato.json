  "sn11.1:4.4": "See BB for readings. Note that Cone acknowledges disati in the sense of “grant”, citing this passage.",
  "sn11.1:7.1": "See BB for the problems with this verse. The Chinese texts at both SA2 43 (活) and SA 1114 (生) appears to support jivati rather than jiyati. Bingenheimer at sa-2.43 has “Have you ever seen or heard of someone who, without effort, attains happiness in life?” Both the Cinese texts have more lines than the Pali, and given that the Pali has five lines, it seems likely the text has suffered loss. I translate according to what I guess the meaning to have been."
