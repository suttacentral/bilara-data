Except it’s a septad not a tetrad; it deals largely with cognitive not sense experience; and there is no mention, here or elsewhere in the EBTs, of “objects”. BB’s explanations of this group show the extent to which it has simply been not listened to by the tradition, concerned only with fitting it into the major categories. But it appears in this specific context for an important reason: it deals, not with sense experience in general, but with the ways in which religious and philosophical views are acquired."
