  "sn24.8:0.3": "Maha here refers to the long explanation of the view, not to its “greatness”.",
  "sn24.8:1.3": "Best to translate kaya according to sense in such philosophical contexts. For akatavidha, the idea here is that the “10,000 things” of the world are derived from these fundamental substances.",
  "sn24.8:1.4": "BB’s rendering “to others” allows the interpretation that they can’t cause pain to things outside the seven. But the meaning is as I state.",
  "sn24.8:1.11": "I note a few places my interpretation differs from BB’s. For the ajivakasatani, etc., I find it implausible that anyone would classify so many types of wanderers. On the other hand, we know that the Jains maintained a census of the numbers of their following, and something similar is found in the EBTs, too. So I think this should be a census of their population. Similar problems occur throughout, so I play it safe by not specifying “kind of”. In addition, given the context, I think nāgavāsa is a corruption of naggavāsa, and translate accordingly. For -gabbha, I take this as somewhat similar to the Buddha’s teaching about those who arise in the womb either mindful or not. For pavuta, and its variants, this is extremely dubious. However, from the context i think it’s likely to refer to some geoform. I take it from pa+vāta.",
  "sn24.8:1.15": "The SN reading seems to me corrupt, and I adopt the reading as found in DN and MN."
