  "dn16:1.20.4": "Brahmali: tuṇhībhāvena is instrumental, suggesting that the silence itself constituted the consent.",
  "dn16:1.25.4": "Brahmali: Suññāgāra normally means an empty dwelling, but here the context suggests another meaning is intended. DA.1.151 says: Suññāgāranti pāṭiyekkaṃ suññāgāraṃ nāma natthi, tattheva pana ekapasse sāṇipākārena parikkhipitvā–‘idha satthā vissamissatī’ti mañcakaṃ paññapesuṃ, “Suññāgāra: it is not a distinct (dwelling) that is called a suññāgāra. But they prepared a bed to one side right there, having surrounded it with a curtain, thinking, ‘The Teacher will rest here’.”",
  "dn16:1.26.1": "Note nagara here, as often, means “citadel, fortress”, not “city”.",
  "dn16:1.28.7": "Comm. is surely correct here: putabhedana refers to the breaking of packages, i.e. a trade center.",
  "dn16:1.31.13": "I think it’s unlikely bhadrani means “auspcious'. Most commonly it” s used to describe chariots. And the similar line at AN 4.67 is applied to animals.",
  "dn16:1.33.2": "Dinghy is a Hindi word: “any of various rowing or sailing boats used in sheltered waters along the Indian coasts to transport passengers and freight.”",
  "dn16:1.33.3": "Brahmali: Yes, it's a different verb, but from what I have seen they are used synonymously.",
  "dn16:1.34.3": "annava can hardly mean “sea” here, if it is to be crossed with a bridge. Note the Sanskrit parallels at https://staging.suttacentral.net/sf245/san/waldschmidt#7.9 and https://staging.suttacentral.net/divy3/san/vaidya#034.012",
  "dn16:2.5.2": "The plural is used here, so strictly speaking “(the land of the) Nadikas”.",
  "dn16:2.6.6": "I spell the names the same as at SN 55.10.",
  "dn16:2.16.1": "There are various reading for pativattesi. I quite like that reading “forced them back”. Anandajoti has “rolled alongside” evidently reading parivattesi. Comm, however, has “Parivaṭṭesīti pahari”.",
  "dn16:2.16.3": "I don’t know if it’s possible to be very literal, but i think it’s important to preserve something of the flavor of the insulting vocative je here, otherwise used of the “bad girl” Kali in MN 21.",
  "dn16:2.25.11": "Reading vedhanissayena following Levman",
  "dn16:3.48.7": "paccāvamissati has several variants, but this should be the correct one. It occurs in Ja 69 and Ja 509, where it is the opposite of vamati (which is in the passage above), i.e. you wouldn’t swallow back what you have vomited out. Comm: Puna paccāvamissatīti yaṃ cattaṃ vantaṃ, taṃ vata puna paṭikhādissatīti attho",

  "dn16:4.27.18": "Anandajotis’ “having gained” is incorrect.",
  "dn16:4.32.15": "Question mark is wrong.",
  "dn16:4.35.4": "I think the use of verbs for the garments is corrupt through this passage. Skt uses acchadeti throughout. Here upanameti means “brings close” cf Pj1. Below, it means “place on his body”, cf. SN 10.3",
  "dn16:4.41.7": "Adopt PTS reading. Comm: “pavattā bhagavā idha dhammeti bhagavā idha sāsane dhamme pavattā, caturāsīti dhammakkhandhasahassāni pavattānīti attho”",
  "dn16:4.42.2": "The subject is unspecified in the Pali. It is not koci, for that forms a regular idiom with vippatisara. The Skt says vipratisāraḥ pareṣām āpāditaḥ",
  "dn16:4.42.12": "Note the text starts to use ayasma here for Cunda. There seems to be some confusion felt between the monk attendant Cundaka and Cunda. But the usage here seems to be driven by grammar. Earlier avuso was used, but as an indeclinable it doesn’t work in instrumental, so apparently ayasmata is the fallback instrumental form; they are both from the same root. It is a nice reminder of the fluidity of such usages. The sanskrit too has saṃmukhaṃ ma āyuṣmaṃś cunda",
  "dn16:5.1.7": "A sad detail here: previously when lying down, his mind was focused on getting up. Sob!",
  "dn16:5.3.9": "This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in the Mara section above.",

  "dn16:5.6.3": "Following Anandajoti, cakkhuma is the most obvious reading. Note that while antaradhayi usually takes the locative, the English idiom makes more sense with ablative.",

  "dn16:5.14.5": "advayena appamāṇena seem out of place here, normally they describe jhana, AN 10.25. But it is also found in the Skt: ānanda maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena",
  "dn16:5.15.2": "Cp SN 47.14, DN 20",
  "dn16:5.26.3": "See my note on the parallel at MN 30.",
  "dn16:5.27.9": "Padesavattī is difficult. Anandajoti has “Existing in the realm of the right Teaching” evidently taking vatti in the sense of exist, be present, and padesa as a place. Walshe more poetically has “To roam the realm of wisdom’s law”. Neither of these agree with comm, which has “Padesavattīti padese vipassanāmagge pavattanto”. However the Sanskrit has āryasya dharmasya pradeśavaktā, where vaktā means “speaker” and pradeśa presumably has the sense “pointing out”. Thus, “I have been the teacher who points out the noble teaching.” While disagreeing in details, this agrees with the thrust of the comm, in that it is to do with teaching. BTW, note that the Skt text has complete verses here and is far more satisfactory. It looks like the Pali has suffered loss of a couple of padas.",
  "dn16:6.1.5": "It’s tempting to read pannatta here as “laid down”, as per Anandajoti, but see eg DN 9 “‘Sassato loko’ti kho, poṭṭhapāda, mayā anekaṃsiko dhammo desito paññatto;”",
  "dn16:6.4.4": "the pair vattabba anusasitabba is found quite frequently, eg An 4.111, AN 10.18, MN 15, etc. These are all similar contexts. However, it seems that the more limited sense of vattabba as “advise, correct, admonish” is applicable in such cases, for which especially see MN 15. It seems, therefore, unlikely that the brahmadanda involved actually refusing to speak to him. Normally I render ovada as “advice” or “instructions”, which is also what I use for vattabba in this context, so I just have two terms in the translation.",
  "dn16:6.8.3": "Following Anandajoti, who folows comm in seeing this as a question.",
  "dn16:6.10.18": "Of the two variants of this line, note that Skt attributes ’ackkhuma'to Sahampati, and kalamakari to Anuruddha.",
  "dn16:6.10.28": "Note that here the text omits kese pakiriya, for obvious reasons. The Pali is almost always incredibly precise in such tiny details!",
  "dn16:6.14.2": "Both MW and Anandajoti take it that this means to carry it out of the city to the south. But I can’t see how this is justified either by context or syntax. They are already outside the town.",
  "dn16:6.14.3": "Note that this context confirms the sense of ahata and unworn. Elsewhere we have sīsaṃnhāto navaṃ khomayugaṃ nivattho",
  "dn16:6.16.1": "The sense of sandhi here is obscure. I think it means “covered without gaps”.",
  "dn16:6.19.3": "This is probably the ultimate source for the Zen story about the Buddha, Mahakassapa, and a flower.",
  "dn16:6.20.3": "The syntax here is obscure to me. Confusingly, both the former and latter parts of the sentence normally take the instrumental: “sumuttāhaṃ buddhena”; but also “tena homi upadduto”. The Sanskrit is much clearer: “muktāḥ smas tataḥ kaukṛtikān mahallāt || ya evam āha || idaṃ vo bhikṣavaḥ karaṇīyam idam akaraṇīyam”",
  "dn16:6.23.2": "Anandajoti has “neither charcoal was evident, nor was ash of the body left over.”, yielding a strikingly different sense. But the idiom as ountuated here is found in a number of places, including below. Further, sarīrāneva must be plural in accord with the use following: sarīrānaṃ. Previously, sarira (corpse) is singular only.",
  "dn16:6.25.2": "Anandajoti’s “we will not see a share” is incorrect. This is the future second plural of dadati.",
  "dn16:6.28.10": "Anandajoti’s “like a most excellent hall” is incorrect. see CPD."
