  "dn13:4.2": "brahmasahabyatāya does not mean “union with Brahmā” as per RD and MW. It means “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue”, as per AN 4.13 etc.",
  "dn13:10.2": "The identity of these groups is described in the appendix to Jayatilleke’s Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, p. 481. Accordingly, brahmacariya used by MW and PTS should be rejected. Skt is Bahvṛca. I use the variant Bavhadija since it is closest to that. Note that Jayatilleke quotes RD SBE 11 as giving the variant Bavharija, but this is incorrect, in fact he has the same variant as PTS, i.e. Bavhadija. Bavharija would be preferable, but I can’t find it attested.",
  "dn13:13.3": "Cp. DN 11.",
  "dn13:36.2": "The reading visāra is difficult, and both RD and MW appear to have used visāda. But this is not really idiomatic. Comm says “Saṃsīditvā visāraṃ pāpuṇantīti evaṃ paṅke viya saṃsīditvā visāraṃ aṅgamaṅgasaṃbhañjanaṃ pāpuṇanti”, which must rely on visāra in the sense of “speading, diffusion”. Apart from the occurrence in the end-of-section titles in Pj4, where we find visāraka, this appears to be the only use in the EBTs.",
  "dn13:39.2": "Quotes are incoorect in text. Apparently the statement itslef is taken as a quote, I have heard “…”",
  "dn13:39.4": "Note he addresses Vasettha alone in singular.",
  "dn13:80.3": "This shows that pariggaha here must be possessiveness rather than possessions: just getting into a meditation doesn’t mean you have no possessions, see eg DN 17."
