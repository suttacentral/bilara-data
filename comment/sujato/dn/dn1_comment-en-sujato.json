  "dn1:1.3.1": "saṅkhiyadhamma is a unique term, occurring, so far as I can tell, nowhere else in the Pali literature. The commentary glosses as kathadhamma, and thus Bodhi and Thanissaro effectively just have it as 'conversation'. Rhys Davids followed by Wals have something like 'trend of conversation.' Yet it seems to me that such a unique term in such a prominent position should have a more specific maning. I am not aware of elsewhere in the ENTs where sankya has the plain sense 'conversation'. rather, it is connected with the notion of evaluation, measuring. Here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties evaluate the Sangha.",
  "dn1:1.5.1": "I think this passage is more gently critical of the monks than implied in previous translations. The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific, and is more active than just “giving way”: they “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. sit around judging others). Cp MN 22, where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral hoti, while for the mendicants it uses karaniya, as here.",
  "dn1:1.11.2": "See my note on SN 22.54",
  "dn1:1.13.2": "uyyodhika in the suttas is only used here and at AN 10.30, where is not a sham. And the definition at Pc 50 says Uyyodhikaṃ nāma yattha sampahāro dissati “where strife is seen”.",
  "dn1:1.14.1": "While gambling isn’t mentioned explicitly here, jūtappamādaṭṭhānānuyoga is treated in DN 31 exclusively as gambling, so it seems that is implied.",
  "dn1:1.14.2": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/some-brief-notes-on-games/5329",
  "dn1:1.21.1": "Translations of tiracchana in such contexts (debased, low, etc.) are often harsher than the old explanations. In Bhi pc 49-50, we have Tiracchānavijjā nāma yaṃ kiñci bāhirakaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ, while the commentary says Tiracchānavijjā nāma aniyyānikattā saggamokkhamaggānaṃ tiracchānabhūtā.",
  "dn1:1.26.2": "Omitting hanujappana as it is absent from comm.",
  "dn1:1.35.2": "I have my doubts about this phrase: in every other occurrence, ito bahiddha means “outside of the Buddhist community”. Still, comm and the Chinese text at T21 agree on this sense.",
  "dn1:2.5.7": "Correlation and causation!",
  "dn1:2.10.2": "The parallel with khiddapadosika rather confuses the issue, suggesting a rendering “depraved in mind” here. However elsewhere in the suttas, manopadosa consistently means “malicious intent”, MN 56, MN 93, also see mano padūseyya at MN 21 and MN 28. Thus the contrast here would seem to be greed vs hate. Also note DN 26, “tesaṃ sattānaṃ aññamaññamhi tibbo āghāto paccupaṭṭhito bhavissati tibbo byāpādo tibbo manopadoso tibbaṃ vadhakacittaṃ.”"
