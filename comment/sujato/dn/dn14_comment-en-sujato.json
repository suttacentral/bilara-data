  "dn14:0.2": "The title is not easy to translate. There is no reason to think apadāna was yet in use as a standard term for “story of past lives”; rather, such usage derived from here. Chinese versions of the text have completely different titles: “Seven Buddhas”, “The Great Root”, “Vipassi Buddha”, “The Lineage of the Seven Past Buddhas”. Only the second of these might relate to the Pali. The sense seems to have been “(story about) reaping results of deeds”.",
  "dn14:1.1.2": "Kareri doesn’t seem to have a recognized English name.",
  "dn14:1.7.1": "Both RD and MW say this is the lifespan in that eon. And it is true that this is the normal usage of ayuppamana. However, in such cases the subject in genitive is given as plural, to denote the entire generation, etc. Here it is singular, and specifies only Vipassi. Sure, it’s likely that this would have been typical, but I don’t think that’s what the text is saying. Note that when the Buddha speaks of his own life, he uses a different phrasing. If ayuppamana here referred to the lifespan of the current generation, there would be no reason for the Buddha to not apply it to himself. But if it means that of the individual, then it makes sense why he would shift to a more indirect statement.",
  "dn14:1.8.2": "puṇḍarīka is the white lotus; Comm says this is setamba, which must have been a tree with lotus-like flowers, I guess.",
  "dn14:1.8.7": "peepul seems to be the most common of the many words for the Bodhi tree.",
  "dn14:1.10.1": "Both RD and MW have “assemblies”, which is a little misleading. It doesn’t refer to permanent groupings, but events.",
  "dn14:1.37.4": "MW is wrong here.",
  "dn14:2.6.7": "Both RD and MW misconstrue this idiom. It is commonly used in the sense of “shortly, in no long time”, i.e. “hopefully” something will happen.",
  "dn14:2.10.1": "Neither reading vilāta or milāta appears to occur elsewhere in this sense. Comm says “Vilātanti sivikaṃ”; Tika says: “Bhantanettakuppalādi vividhaṃ katvā lātabbato vilāto, vayhaṃ, sivikā cāti āha ‘‘vilātanti sivika’’nti. Sivikāya diṭṭhapubbattā mahāsatto citakapañjaraṃ ‘‘sivika’’nti āha”.",
  "dn14:2.16.7": "Following PTS in omitting janapada, which seems out of place here, and is absent from the parallel passage in DN 19.",
  "dn14:2.21.2": "The PTS’s inclusion of vipassana here, unaccountably followed by RD and MW, is an egregious and embarassing error. No manuscript contains this reading, and the PTS edition itself states that the word is found only in the commentary. To be clear, there it is obviously presented not as a reading but as an explanation: “Maggoti vipassanāmaggo.”",
  "dn14:3.9.1": "Comm takes khema as a proper name; it is a common name for sanctuaries in the Jatakas.",
  "dn14:3.29.18": "This is basically a table of contents for any Buddha biography.",
  "dn14:3.29.20": "While this is absent here, they are all mentioned below, and comm says they should be included here. This must be just a clumsy abbreviation.",
  "dn14:3.30.1": "In PTS, unlike MS, the deities who came to see the Buddha are numbered as “hundreds”, which seems more reasonable. RD has this, while MW does not."
