  "dn29:10.1": "Comm: aviññāpitatthāti abodhitatthā. I think this is a mistake. it is to be understood in line with the Buddha inviting the monks to question him on his deathbed. viññāpita is used in the sense “asked about or for”.",
  "dn29:12.1": "Both RD and MW seem to take this as referring to a monk. But it refers to the Buddha, as is made clear in the recapitulation.",
  "dn29:27.5": "Both MW and RD have optative mod here, but it is not justified.",
  "dn29:35.2": "RD and MW phrase this as a question, which is unjustified.",
  "dn29:44.2": "Both RD and MW take dhamma in (at)thitadhamma here as “doctrine”, but it is at AN 8.19 in the same context, but of the ocean, where it just means “stable”. Both places are glossed as ṭhitasabhāvā. Incidentally, the context here shows that PTS dict’s “eternal” for AN 8.19 is wrong."
