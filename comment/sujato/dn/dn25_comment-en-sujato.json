  "dn25:1.3": "RD and MW oddly have “discourse to the udumbarikans”. Comm explains the term as “Udumbarikāya paribbājakārāmeti udumbarikāya deviyā santake paribbājakārāme” In Chinese, DA 8 has “烏暫婆利梵志女林” The forest of the Udumbara brahmin lady “, MA 104 has” 優曇婆邏林 “Udumbara forest”, T 11 has “烏曇末梨園” “Udumbara park”.",
  "dn25:5.10": "orodheyyāmā is unclear. I follow comm: Orodheyyāmāti vinandheyyāma. Pūritaghaṭo hi ito cito ca parivattetvā na suvinandhanīyo hoti. Rittako yathāruci parivattetvā sakkā hoti vinandhituṃ, evameva hatapaññatāya rittakumbhisadisaṃ samaṇaṃ gotamaṃ vādavinandhanena samantā vinandhissāmāti vadati.",
  "dn25:7.17": "The idiom katham santā is unusual, but it clearly echoes evaṃ sante below",
  "dn25:10.12": "Usually sapekkha is used in the sense of missing something, or longing for it when it’s gone.",
  "dn25:11.12": "As noted by MW, comm here says “adassayamānoti ettha a-kāro nipātamattaṃ, dassayamānoti attho”. But this seems odd. Tika says ‘‘Ādassayamāno’’ti vā pāṭho. Again, this seems odd. If the first explanation is good, why need another? And if it is a genuine reading, it does not seem to be attested. Further, ādassana doesn’t seem to be attested as a genuine Pali term.",
  "dn25:11.16": "Note that comm applies this to views “Kiñcidevāti kiñci vajjaṃ diṭṭhigataṃ vā”, but earlier in the sutta “idaṃ me khamati, idaṃ me nakkhamatī’ti.” is applied to preferences regarding food.",
  "dn25:16.5": "Cp AN 3.163",
  "dn25:16.8": "This term is unique. Comm has “Na bhāvitamāsīsatīti bhāvitaṃ nāma tesaṃ saññāya pañca kāmaguṇā, te na āsīsati na sevatīti attho.”"
