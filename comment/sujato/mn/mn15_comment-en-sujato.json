  "mn15:3.32": "apadana has the root meaning of “reaping, harvest”, hence the more common sense of “story of past lives, i.e. deeds and their consequences”.",
  "mn15:6.1": "Anumana seems to only occur twice in the EBTs, here and SN 22.36. There, BB accepts the sense “measure against”. It seems to me this meaning applies here. the passage specifically discusses, not an inference in general, but how one is to measure oneself against another. This, of course, reads straight from the etymology of the term. Moreover, this sense makes the whole sutta hang together better. The next section refers to paccavekkhana, i.e. “reflection”. So this section is about an external standard, the next section is about an inner standard. In later texts, especially Mil 6.4.1, anumana did indeed come to mean “inference”."
