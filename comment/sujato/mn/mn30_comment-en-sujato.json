  "mn30:2.4": "BB’s rendering (followed by Thanissaro) groups sakaya patinnaya with just the first kind of claim, but surely it should apply to all three, as in Horner. Furthermotre, it is better to translate as “do all claim direct knowledge” rather than “do all have direct knowledge, as they claim”. In DN 2 Ajita propounds the view: “natthi loke samaṇabrāhmaṇā … sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā pavedenti”. Given that religious texts typically present the views of rivals in a negative light (odium theologicum) it is a good practice to translate these as sympathetically as possible, i.e. to not impute any contradictions or absurdities not clearly required by the text. Thus since at least one of these claimed that no-one had direct knowledge, it would be a direct contradiction of their own views to claim such for themselves. Given that the text allows us to translate it in a way so as to avoid such contradiction, we should choose this approach."
