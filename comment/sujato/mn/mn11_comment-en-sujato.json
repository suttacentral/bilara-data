  "mn11:2.2": "In the parallel passage at AN 4.241 BB renders this as a quote.",
  "mn11:3.2": "The idiom “ko assaso kim balam” is found only here and at MN 93. There, it also deals with an unequivocal claim to superiority. But the brahmin avoids the question, whereas here it is answered directly. A normal sense of assaso is “confidence”. Given that the answer does, in fact, deal with confidence, it seems this is relevant here. BB’s “on the strength of what argument or what authority” doesn’t quite catch it.",
  "mn11:3.11": "Curiously enough, this appears to be the only occurrence of sahadhammika in this sense in the EBTs. The parallel at MA 103 has 同道.",
  "mn11:5.20": "Not sure why BB has “vision” here.",
  "mn11:13.1": "BB evidently takes akkhayati in the sense of “it is plain” (?) I’m not sure why, the normal sense of “it is said” works fine. It seems to be supported by the comm, and relates to the following durakkhata. The term sammaggata is apparently only found here. I think BB’s “rightly directed” is overly literal, it simply means “become right, proper or ideal”."
