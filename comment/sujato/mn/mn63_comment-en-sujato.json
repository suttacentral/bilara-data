  "mn63:5.9": "BB has “lets the surgeon pull out the arrow” which obviously makes sense, but I can’t see that it’s grammatically justified.",
  "mn63:5.19": "BB’s and PTS dict’s crossbow is probably impossible at this time. Acc. to Ven Nyanatusita, kudandaka is a pliant cane, so he suggests “cane bow or wood bow”",
  "mn63:5.21": "These from Nyanatusita.",
  "mn63:5.27": "Comm. says “kalasiha” for bherava, but acc. to the variant roruva it seems more likely to = ruru i.e. a reddish deer. the swamp deer is a large Indian deer, which is endangered, so I pay homage to it here. Semhara is, acc. to comm. a kind of monkey. It was probably a large-ish species, so gibbon is a guess.",
  "mn63:5.29": "Again from Nyanatusita. Note that calves lose their teeth, and the roots are evidently quite sharp.",
  "mn63:6.1": "This is a double conditional, the sense being that if the pre-condition is met, the subsequent act would follow. This is echoing Malunkya’s conditions. This is why the grammar here differs from the more straightfoward cases of such statements, eg at SN 12.35, SN 22.96, AN 3.100. I.e. if there is the the view (locative absolute) then the would be (conditional) the brahmacariya. Literally: “It is not true that when there is the view “The world is eternal” there would be the living of the spiritual life.” This requires that the syntax be construed as a nested quote, with evam no being the Buddha’s voice. Omitting the vocative for clarity: |“‘Sassato loko’ti diṭṭhiyā sati brahmacariyavāso abhavissā”ti, evaṃ no| The ending evam no is odd, and it normally means “thus of us”, but here it seems a negative is required, as per the comm."
