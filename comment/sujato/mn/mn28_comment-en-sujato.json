  "mn28:6.4": "NOTE: Adopting Brahmali’s “organic” for upadinna. Note that most of what follows are, in fact “organs”.",
  "mn28:7.4": "NOTE: For this idiomatic use of atha kho in a sentence, compare DN 23, Kiñcāpi bhavaṃ kassapo evamāha, atha kho evaṃ me ettha hoti. This sentence is difficult, and the punctuation is MS is improbable. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-one-sentence-of-the-greater-elephant-footprint/3928",
  "mn28:8.7": "NOTE: Nyanamoli/BB’s “objective basis” is an unwarranted intrusion of abhidhamma ideas. This set of verbs always occur together and there is no need to treat them any other way here. arammana in the EBTs typically means something close to “meditation subject”. It’s used in the sense of the contemplative practice, relying on which, the desired outcome is achieved.",
  "mn28:12.1": "NOTE: Older translations take this in the sense “gets angry”, while BB and Thanissaro have “disturbed, agitated”. the former is unjustified as the elements are not personalized, while the latter is too weak. The term is only used, here and AN 5.197, in the sense of a sudden destructive expansion or inflation; note that the term is not used for the next passage, where there is a diminution."
