  "mn27:4.4": "While the dict, followed by translators, treats osarati in a neutral sense here “visit”, the contexts don’t bear this out. It is used in a literal sense of “come down” (from the wilderness, specially the Himalayas) (AN 6.42), with a side-order of “fall so low as to …” or even “descend upon” (like the plague).",

  "mn27:10.18": "BB, Thanissaro, and Horner all take “kaneruka “as” having tusks”, but this seems unjustified. If the PTS dict (following comm.) is right in saying kaneru is a “young elephant”, we can take “kaneruka” as a possessive, i.e. “she-elephant with calves”, i.e. “mature, fully-grown”, which is, in any case, implied by the context."
