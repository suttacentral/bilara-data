  "mn66:7.3": "All the translations, so far as I can see, follow comm. in saying that the person becomes bitter towards monks who want to train “such as Sariputta and Moggallana”. But this seems unlikely to me. The sentence has three “ca” -s, suggesting each of these is a distinct clause. The former passage indicates bitterness to the Buddha, not other monks. And bhikkhu sikkhakama is nominative; it should be locative in such a reading. I think MS’s punctuation is correct in separating the following phrase (although because of the cas it is probably best considered part of the same sentence)",
  "mn66:14.6": "BB has the “diversity of faculties in this person”. But elsewhere when this phrase is used, it always refers to what distinguishes the spiritual development of one person as compared to another. Thus we are better taking this as a locative of reference."
