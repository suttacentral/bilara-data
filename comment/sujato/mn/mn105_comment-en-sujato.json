  "mn105:4.5": "Normally kacci te idioms have a sense of “Ihope that “or” I trust that”. Here, I think this is justified by the non-standard way the “or” idiom is applied; i.e. it’s not just a straight “va” construction.",
  "mn105:5.7": "reaing ce, against the comm. But it doesn’t really make sense to me otherwise.",
  "mn105:9.12": "The reading is problematic, and BB follows several manuscripts in omitting āneñjasaṃyojanena hi kho visaṃyutto. However, as the MS notes, it is commented on: Āneñjasaṃyojanena hi kho visaṃyuttoti āneñjasamāpattisaṃyojanena visaṃsaṭṭho. But the idea that such a person is genuinely detached from the anenja cannot be right. I suspect there was an old confused reading, and that this line connects back to the immediately prior anenjapatisamyutta. i.e. they’re not detached from the “fetter” of the anenja, but from “what is connected with” the anenja, i.e. the talk, etc. as discussed earlier.",
  "mn105:11.2": "Here and below, the verb echoes the simile, a connection missed in BB.",
  "mn105:19.6": "See BB’s note on why anupa-is to be preferred here. See also Analayo, Comparative Study, p 611 note 136 “SHT IV 500 folio 3V 3 reads [sā]va[ś]eṣaṃ nira[va](śe)ṣaṃ (iti manyamānaḥ); cf. also SHT X 3274V 3”"
