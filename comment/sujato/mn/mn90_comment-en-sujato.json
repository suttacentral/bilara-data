  "mn90:13.6": "See BB’s note. It seems to me the text is corrupt. However, despite the variants, the terms sabyabajjha and abyabajjha are well established in this exact context, and it seems to me very unlikely that “ill-will” could be meant here.",
  "mn90:14.11": "Use of bho is unusual here, obviously he was not as devoted as his father.",
  "mn90:14.19": "Is this the only use of bho with raja?",
  "mn90:15.4": "BB has “venerable sir” as vocative here, which is incorrect. Pasenadi always uses bhante as vocative, and anyway, bho doesn’t mean venerable sir. In fact, in such idioms vata bho is just an exclamation, and is frequently not used as a vocative at all."
