  "mn94:2.6": "This is, I think, the only time when ambho samana is used as address. I think it is deliberately clumsy, a sign that Ghotamukha, having never met a monk before, doesn’t really know the right way to address them.",
  "mn94:2.8": "Given Ghotamukha’s statement below, I think he is being deliberately provocative here. he’s like people who comment on an article and begin with, “well, I haven’t read the article, but …”",
  "mn94:8.1": "Punctuation in MS is incorrect, compare the parallel phrasing in MN 43",
  "mn94:8.5": "BB’s “in order to learn” is not supported by comm. Nor is anuggaha used in the sense of “learn “, so far as I know, only as” support, help “. Comm: Sānuggahā vācā bhāsitā sakāraṇā vācā bhāsitā. Vuttañhetaṃ mayā ‘‘amhākaṃ kathā appamāṇaṃ, dhammova pamāṇa’’nti.” Sānuggahā vācā bhāsitā means “what was spoken was with reason. For I said that thinking:” our speech is limitless, but the teaching is limited.”",
  "mn94:33.1": "niccabhikkha is a curious idiom, not, so far as I know, discussed in any available dictionary. In Ja 398 it refers to the daily offering of food to a yakkha, and this must be the early meaning. here and at SN 3.13 it is explicitly said to refer to money, so this must have evolved. the fact that Udena has to ask what kind of offering it is shows that it still might have meant food.",
  "mn94:33.3": "At SN 3.13 it is one hundred kahapanas. Both these are in the ballpark of what might be “dollars” today.",
  "mn94:33.5": "BB has “monastery”, but vihara means “dwelling” in the EBTs. Moreoever, he would hardly have built a whole monastery for one monk.",
  "mn94:33.6": "Showing the shift of locus for the Sangha after the Buddha died."
