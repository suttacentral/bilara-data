  "mn60:9.2": "Nyanamoli/Bodhi’s “will have made themselves safe” is future perfect, which is rare in pali and seems to require the past participle. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-future-perfect-tense-in-pali/4630/7 Horner notes the problem without offering a solution. There are no parallels, and comm. and tika are silent. Not just the grammar, but the sense seems impossible. How can annihilation be safety? Normally the idiom attanam karoti is used as you would expect, when you find safety, i.e. survive. Anyway, how is the person actually doing anything? If there is no afterlife, that’s just how it is, they are not making themselves anything at all. I think the text is corrupt, and have no solution. Perhaps it originally meant something like: “If there is no other world, then, for all that this individual tries to keep themselves safe, still their body breaks up.” But I see no way to justify this on the current text.",
  "mn60:9.4": "I can’t see how Nyanamoli/Bodhi arrive at “whether or not …” Thanissaro translates “Even if we didn’t speak of the next world” evidently reading mā āhu rather than mā ahu, but the aorist is required here. And this omits kamam, which here must mean something like “allow that, assume that”. Cp. the English “if you will”. Note that to assume is to “take up”, cp. upadana, ahara, which are quasi synonyms of kama.",
  "mn60:13.2": "BB has “acts” for kar here, which is too vague. It must mean “punish”, as at AN 4.121 etc.",
  "mn60:29.2": "BB’s “definitely no immaterial realms” is surely incorrect. The abstract aruppa is never, so far as I know, used for the, but is regularly used of the meditation attainments: ye te santā vimokkhā atikkamma rūpe āruppā. Further, sabbaso does not mean “definitely”, rather it is part of the standard formula introducing the formless attainments: sabbaso rūpasaññānaṃ samatikkamā"
