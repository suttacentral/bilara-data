  "mn37:7.1": "BB’s “endowed a hundredfold with the five kinds of heavenly music” is obscure and inaccurate. This is obviously an idiom for a divine amplification of the standard pancangika turiya, translated in AN by BB as “quintet”, which I follow.",
  "mn37:8.5": "Following Nyanatusita’s suggestion and comm. Here, no = pronoun.",
  "mn37:9.3": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/celestial-maidens-have-nothing-to-be-ashamed-about/3984",
  "mn37:10.5": "The gods are pointing out various pretty things (idampi … idampi …) Chalmers and Horner get this right, but BB does not.",
  "mn37:10.6": "This is a surprisingly knotty idiom. Cp. SN 11.1 and 2, which also include Sakka, the word sobhati, and the idea of making merit in the past. That context draws out the slightly passive-aggressive nature of what Moggallana says here; he’s kind of praising him for having made merit, but also kind of criticizing him for living off his past. The verb sobhati in such cases is very idiomatic. Nyanatusita suggests “befits”, which apparently BB adopts in Connected Discourses. But I think the idea is that it looks nice for someone like Sakka (who is interested in such things).",
  "mn37:11.7": "BB’s “heavenly region” is incorrect. bhavana is used for the home of a divine being, eg SN 10.1, AN 6.54",
  "mn37:14.2": "BB has “attendants”, but it is feminine plural nominative, as previously.",
  "mn37:14.8": "BB’s “how much more so that …” is incorrect. Aho nuna … means “Surely that must be …”. The maidens are expressing their amazement that anyone but Moggallana might be the teacher. 'We can't belive that …' is not literal, but is less confusing in English."
