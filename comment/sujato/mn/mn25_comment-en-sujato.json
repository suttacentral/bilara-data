  "mn25:5.20": "I take the unusual construction here as strongly emphatic, with the repeated use of nāma. parajana elsewhere simply means “another person” (Mil 6.3.1) but comm here glosses it as yakkha. A yakkha named Parajana makes an appearance in MN 31. The term literally means “alien”. Presumably it has a sense not dissimilar to “amanussa”.",
  "mn25:5.22": "Nyanamoli/BB’s “wicker hurdles” is too clever: vakara/vagura is the same root as wicker. But it’s hardly likely that an entire area was enclosed in wicker. The normal sense is “net”, so presumably it meant nets strung on high stakes. The deer or whatever would have leap over it, thus revealing their position.",
  "mn25:9.6": "This a ghost sentence, formed by adding the first part of the subsequent sentence with the second part of the previous. It is absent from the PTS text."
