  "mn86:3.9": "Saṃharitvā saṃharitvā is the obvious reading. But comm. says “Saṅkaritvā saṅkaritvāti saṅketaṃ katvā vaggavaggā hutvā” where sanketa evidently relies on sankaritva, but the term is read as implying “grouped”, i.e. samharitva. A sign of an old corruption? Also, note that the idiom is emphatic.",
  "mn86:3.10": "Attha in hatthattha is attha2, as per comm: “Hatthatthaṃ gacchantīti hatthe atthaṃ vināsaṃ gacchanti”, a point overlooked by most translators.",
  "mn86:4.7": "pasayha manne is obscure here, and this is a guess at the sense.",
  "mn86:6.11": "taking me to apply to mahita; I prefer this because of proximity and thinness; it adds less meaning. Readings as per PTS, etc.",
  "mn86:9.4": "BB’s “attacking” seems a little excessive for kupita.",
  "mn86:14.2": "Mulha here should be connected with the common sense of having “lost” the path, and hence unable to emerge. See Ud 2.8. The modern term is obstructed labor.",
  "mn86:14.4": "This is a difficult line. I have not traced a parallel in the Chinese versions, nor does comm or tika say anything. While obviously kilesa and variants normally refer to mental defilement, here it seems the bloody messiness of childbirth is meant. Compare, say, Snp 3.10, referring to people being immersed in blood and pus in hell, or Iti 83, where the deva’s cloths become “dirtied”. BB has “afflicted”, Thanissaro has “tormented”, and Nyanamoli had “what defilements they suffer”: but none of these capture the organic mess of it. We should not ignore the strong taboo notions around childbirth. The point here is that in samsara, birth is undergone by all beings, and the messiness of it afflicts both mother and child.",
  "mn86:18.25": "pappuyya is absolutive, not optative as per BB."
