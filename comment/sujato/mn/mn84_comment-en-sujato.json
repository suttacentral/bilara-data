  "mn84:4.5": "For orasa, BB has “offspring” here and “bosom sons” at SN 22.76 (the latter combing with putta). neither of these seem ideal; “offspring” is merely biological, while “bosom” really means “intimate”, which is not really the point. In the Sanskrit, while there are a variety of meanings, the most common and most relevant is “legitimate, rightful”. The point here is not that they are the only children of Brahma—for surely all creatures are created by Brahma—but that they are his legitimate heirs.",
  "mn84:6.5": "arahatam is genitive plural."
