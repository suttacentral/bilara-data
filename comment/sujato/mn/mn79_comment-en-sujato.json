  "mn79:5.4": "Cp. SN 56. At DN 2 this is the attitude of a servant to the king.",
  "mn79:5.5": "The exact same phrase is used on the Buddha’s assembly at MN 77. The different attitude is fascinating: the Buddha’s assembly is poised expectantly, Udayins are gazing up at his face.",
  "mn79:6.4": "BB adopts the PTS reading piti here, which is unlikely. A similar phrase recurs at MN 89 and DN 9, neither time with any variants. At MN 89 BB has “reminded him of the Blessed One”.",
  "mn79:18.1": "Ābhā nanubhonti is glossed in MN 79 as obhāsaṃ na vaḷañjanti. This is a difficult term, but acc. to PTS dict means “leave a mark”. In AN 4.127 the same phrase is glossed pabhā nappahonti, i.e. “light is ineffective”. Neither gloss supports “matches” or “reaches”.",
  "mn79:21.2": "Vā is frequently conjunctive, and I think this makes more sense here.",
  "mn79:27.3": "BB’s “dwells” for santitthati is misleading. In a parallel passage in AN 8.54 he has “associates”."
