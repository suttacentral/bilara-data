  "mn8:3.3": "This question is a little curiously phrased in the Pali, and I suspect some corruption. The idiom adimeva occurs several times in the Samyutta (SN 47.15, etc.), where it refers to a mendicant purifying the “starting point” of kusala dhamma, i.e. sila and ditthi. Since ditthi are also spoken of here, the context must be the same. Thus BB following the comm errs in inserting “meditative training” here, as this “adi” is specifically said to precede meditation, as indeed it does in this sutta. (Neither MA 91 nor EA 47.9 appears to have close parallel to this phrase) This is just the start of the comm’s systematic misinterpretation of this sutta. Further, the question must be “how” this is done, as that is the answer the Buddha gives. Both Chinese texts have 云何 here, which typically stands for katham = how?",
  "mn8:12.2": "The idiom here with “sallekho karaniyo” is strikingly reminiscent of the sekhiyas in the Vinaya, each of which ends with sikkha karaniya"
