  "mn57:2.1": "Note that while Seniya is said to be an acela, a naked ascetic, Punna is not; in fact, nowhere does it say he is an ascetic at all. Indeed, while examples of Seniya’s dog-behavior are given, such are lacking for Punna. Perhaps he observed his duty more in the omission than the commission. While it is likely he was an ascetic, we should probably avoid specifying this, lacking confirmation in the text.",
  "mn57:2.4": "Here as throughout I agree with BB, note 634 in Connected Discourses on SN 11.11 that we should read samatta in such contexts as = samātta, i.e. a synonym to samādinna. However I just translate two terms together as “undertake”."
