  "mn5:10.1": "Both MS and BB are unclear as to the speaker here. BB’s section 9 attibutes the proceeding phrases to sariputta. But surely the question is an interjection by Moggallana, as indicated by the punctuation in MS. However, to start a new speaker here, as MS does, is to suggest that this passage is spoken by Moggallana, which is surely incorrect. The close -ti in the previous segment must simply indicated a quoted term.",
  "mn5:31.7": "BB’s “son of a former cartwright” is implausible. Surely the point is that he used to be a cartwright. The idiom -putta is often disserved by rendering it as “son”; here it just means that he is “one of the cartwrights”, or “from a family of cartwrights”.",
  "mn5:31.9": "suddhā assa sāre patiṭṭhitā recurs at AN 4.190 (of an assembly) and AN 3.93 (of seeds and monks). In both cases BB has “pure, established in the core”, whereas here he has “come to consist purely of heartwood”.",
  "mn5:32.3": "BB follows PTS edition here, but MS is preferable. PTS omits the close -ti, and hence treats this sentence as a simple continuation of Moggallana’s speech. But it reads much better as an exclamation by the good monks."
