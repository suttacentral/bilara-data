  "mn136:2.9": "Quote marks in MS are incorrect. Here, as shown by the avuso, samiddhi is directly addressing Potaliputta.",
  "mn136:6.5": "Ummagga is from ummujjati, just below, “uprising, emergence”.",
  "mn136:6.15": "This specific phrasing is shared with MN 136 and AN 6.62. In both cases, the context follows a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. I think the phrasing is meant to express a certain frustration, if I may dare to use such a term of the Buddha! The parsing of vibhajantassa is problematic, see BB’s note on AN 6.62."
