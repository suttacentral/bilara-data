  "mn87:2.2": "An unusual use of patibhati. Comm says “ruccati”.",
  "mn87:4.1": "So, what, this was normal in the monastery?",
  "mn87:5.1": "Also a scene for gossip in AN 3.60, AN 10.45",
  "mn87:29.2": "I find the PTS reading with the repeated paññāya to be implausible.",
  "mn87:29.3": "The exact sense of this phrase is difficult. At AN 6.37, it says that one gives after rinsing ones own hands. The form here seems to be “Come, Mallika, rinse!” But this seems hard to justify. Comm says it means “give the rinsing water”, which makes sense, but the verb acameti always applies to the act of rinsing, so far as i know. I think the king held his hands over a bowl, and Mallika poured water over them."
