  "mn39:2.1": "The verbs sanjanati and paijanati in this opening correlate with samanna and patinna just below. Thus here sanjanati means “to label, designate” rather than “perceive”.",
  "mn39:4.2": "While samvuta usually means “restrained”, here I think it means “hidden, covered up”. The sentence construction is ambiguous and unusual, with the introduction of ca for the last two terms, but na applied to only one of them. But I think na is meant to be distributed. This accords with Comm, which defines chidda as “consistent” and saṃvutoti as “closing a door over the defilements, not concealing one’s faults, is the meaning” kilesānaṃ dvāra pidahanena pidahito, na vajjapaṭicchādanatthāya.'This makes better sense as samvara is brought up in the next section. Chalmers is the only translator who catches this sense.",
  "mn39:14.1": "Note that acc. to AN 4.80 this should be gendered.",
  "mn39:20.3": "BB has “houses” but it is singular; Horner gets this right. thanissaro, in what looks like a copy paste error, has the wrong simile here."
