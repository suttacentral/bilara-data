  "mn128:6.6": "assuming agocara, i.e. out of bounds",
  "mn128:6.22": "Yamamase is an imperative, 'we must control ourselves'. Both in Thag 4.3 and Thag 8.1, however, the context clearly indicates that a pun on Yama, the god of death, is intended. This is confirmed by the commentary, see Norman's note on Thag 4.3. I try to translate in a way that captures both 'must restrain ourselves' and 'we will go to presence of Death'.",
  "mn128:6.27": "Like Dhananjani",
  "mn128:7.1": "I think this means “child salt-workers”. Note that in the only other occurrence of lonakara, at AN 4.188, it is loṇakāradārako. However the readings are uncertain. Nevertheless, child salt miners are sadly common in India even today, so I translate in empathy with them. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7305988/Salt-mining-leaves-bitter-taste-for-Indian-workers.html",
  "mn128:14.7": "https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-holding-hands/5184",
  "mn128:15.5": "Comm: Tañca nimittaṃ nappaṭivijjhāmāti tañca kāraṇaṃ na jānāma, yena no obhāso ca rūpadassanañca antaradhāyati. Note that even the commentary here takes nimitta in the sense of “reason”, not “nimitta”. For related contexts, see AN 6.55, AN 8.70",
  "mn128:16.8": "While it is not always possible to represent tenses literally, I feel that here the switch from past to present is significant. It is recalling an episode in the past in order to infer a universal principle."
