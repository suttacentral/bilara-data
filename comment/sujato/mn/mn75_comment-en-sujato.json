  "mn75:9.2": "The nested quote here in MS is incorrect.",
  "mn75:10.13": "BB’s “surpasses” here is unjustified, and is based on the incorrect commentarial assumption. the passage is about jhana, not arahantship. The idiom samadhigayha titthati is used at Iti 23 and MN 78, where it always means “achieves the level of” or something like that.",
  "mn75:13.1": "Note that “leper” is derogatory, the text has kutthi purisa",
  "mn75:19.16": "This passage is sometimes cited as evidence that Nibbana has a positive connotation, parallel to a positive sense of health. However the Pali does not support this. The word for “health”, arogya, is in fact in the negative, i.e. the absence of disease. Obviously nibbana here means the same thing, the “extinguishment” of disease. While we don’t use the exact same idiom, it makes sense in the context of the many places, including this sutta, where disease and defilements are said to be “fevers” that “burn” you up.",
  "mn75:24.8": "Compare Mark 8.25",
  "mn75:24.10": "Here dahati is better taken as “considers, takes as” rather than “burns” as per BB. Cp. SN 22.85. It’s odd that their first thought is not gratitude but revenge!"
