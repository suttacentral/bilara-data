  "mn93:3.1": "vuttasira only occurs here and in identical passages. The contrast with the normal brahmanical abuse of the muṇḍaka is noteworthy. Also note that in the counterpart passage for old brahmins, a series of words for the age is found here. We thus should find that vuttasira doesn’t just mean shaven, but refers to a specific time of life. According to Manu 2.65, the ceremony of kesanta signifying Vedic studentship is to be given to brahmins at 16, so this must be meant here.",
  "mn93:11.6": "This seems to be the only mention of the padumaka tree in Pali. Skt has “Cerasus Puddum” (= cherry) for padmaka, but “birch” for padmakin.",
  "mn93:15.1": "This is the only occurrence of sodariya in the prose canon. i think it has a stronger sense than “same mother”, else why include it here? The point, I think, is that they were twins, and hence equal in every way, only differentiated by education. Otherwise surely the elder brother would have been senior.",
  "mn93:17.3": "BB follows some MSS in omitting tape, but it seems to be required by the sense. It is unusual for the Buddha to refer to sila as tapas, but there you go.",
  "mn93:18.71": "The final phrase here is probably corrupt, and possibly evokes an unknown idiom. The commentarial explanation is implausible. I translate here according to what I think it means."
