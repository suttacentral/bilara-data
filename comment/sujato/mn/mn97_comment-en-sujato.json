  "mn97:2.8": "BB has “living at the Taṇḍulapāla Gate”, DPPN has “Near the gate was the residence of the brahmin Dhānañjāni.” But it is notable that none of the usual terms for staying or residence are found here (viharati, nivesati, etc.). Nor is this place mentioned elsewhere as his residence. Now, tandula means “rice”, “pala/pali “means” guard”, and dvara is a gate or door. I think Dhananjani was an official who worked at the gate, which was a checkpoint for the movement of rice in and out of the city. It was, i suspect, in this capacity that he was able to to skim off funds.",
  "mn97:5.4": "As for karaniya katabba, this is clearly referring to the bali as at AN 4.61, AN 5.41. For the last two verbs, BB has “refreshed and nourished”. But pinetabbo is probably from pīṇa = fat, swollen, agreeing with bruheti, to increase. These terms are probably unique in this context, and contrast with the expected poseti found earlier. It speaks, I think, to Dhananjani’s sense of entitlement: he merely has to provide for his family, but he must fatten himself.",
  "mn97:16.6": "Reading anne for annesam as in PTS edition. otherwise it would be “others have livelihoods …”"
