  "mn137:13.1": "quotes in MS are wrong.",
  "mn137:22.4": "The Burmese manuscripts appear to be alone in having “displeasure” here. Nor is it supported by the commentary, which has Na ca attamanoti na sakamano. (Sidebar: what? Is this normal in the comms? But at least it’s clearly not the negative form.) However, acc to Analayo, CSMN vol 2 p 786 note 145 the the Buremse agrees with the Chinese. Surely this makes more sense.",
  "mn137:25.3": "It seems that the text is paralleling sārita with sārathi. They are, however from different roots: sārita is pp of the cause sareti, to make move, i.e. drive. Sārathi is sa-rathin, with chariot. It might be either a pun or a dialectical confusion."
