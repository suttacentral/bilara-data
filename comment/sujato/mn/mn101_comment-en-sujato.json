  "mn101:15.3": "This is a difficult sentence, and different translators handle it in quite different ways. I take vipaccetha as second plural optative, intended as a rhetorical question. The sense, I think, plays on the common meaning of “ripen”, but in the sense “make something out of it that it isn’t”, i.e. (mis)construe.",
  "mn101:18.1": "BB’s translation is based on Abhidhamma via comm, and is incorrect.",
  "mn101:22.12": "PTS edition has the expected papa.",
  "mn101:23.4": "BB takes viraga here in the sense of “fade away”, but it seems hard then to differentiate it from nijjinna. In addition, in the simile viraga is used in the sense of dispassion. Thus I think that is the sense here, too."
