  "mn26:15.1": "Translators vary between state and path for pada. however MN 102 suggests “state” must be correct.",
  "mn26:15.4": "Interesting reversal of the usual use of āvuso for junior and āyasmā for senior.",
  "mn26:15.9": "Compare the use of kevalam with -mattena at AN 7.43-3",
  "mn26:15.23": "Note how text in this passage varies the verb with upasampajja: pavedeti for Alara, viharati for Gotama. Chalmers, Warren, and Horner get this right, Bodhi and Thanissaro do not. In addition, BB has “in this way” for ettavata here, which is not very accurate. But see MN 79, where we have sacchikato hissa, bhante, ettāvatā ekantasukho loko hotī in a similar context. There he has, “at this point”. Surely the two passages should be translated consistently.",
  "mn26:16.2": "Note that here the name is omitted.",
  "mn26:16.30": "Interesting that in the aorist here it switches to abhi-jna",
  "mn26:25.21": "According to Cone resolves as ā-han-t-syam, fut. 1 sg. of āhanati = beats.",
  "mn26:26.3": "The universal agreement among translators that this means “made a pact, agreed” is puzzling, unless they’re reading saññapesum; but I can’t find such a reading. Santhapeti in the sense of “stop” is well established, eg vitakkasanthana. The phrase occurs in a similar context at AN 10.93 + 94, where it refers to the noisy wanderers agreeing to stop talking. There BB renders as “silenced one another”, which is fine in context, but doesn’t necessarily apply here. The common feature of both contexts is that they stop each other (from behaving inappropriately).",
  "mn26:27.7": "The referent back to “that” here is odd. In fact the identical phrasing occurs at MN 12, where it does, indeed, refer to the austerities just described. Is this a sign of textual loss here?",
  "mn26:32.6": "This context shows, I think, that yathakamakaraniya is better rendered as “vulnerable”, i.e. “have come to such a state that the hunter is able to do what he wants with them”."
