  "mn129:4.7": "BB omits this portion.",
  "mn129:19.4": "It seems that brahmins, like Jehovah in the Old testament, enjoyed the smell of burnt offerings.",
  "mn129:28.9": "See BB’s note on the negative. However, it seems to me there is no need to supply it. In this first case, the discussion is simply about what is and is not appropriate, and it makes sense for either the good or bad person to say that such things are found in them. In the next case, the acts are explicitly bad, so the negative sense, as found in the ext, is required.",
  "mn129:35.1": "bhinkara and abbhukirati only occur in this context, and deserve elevated renderings.",
  "mn129:35.3": "vasam upeti is the same idiom used for arriving at a guest house. SN 42.13",
  "mn129:35.7": "Bhunjati at MN 98 must relate to the problematic yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha in MN 129, DN 17, and DN 26. Most translators have, implausibly, “eat”. At MN 98, Norman has “enjoy” while BB has “govern”. But the meaning probably is similar to the archaic English form “use”, in the legal sense of “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha means “use as has been used”, i.e. “don’t increase taxes”.",

  "mn129:36.2": "For an explanation of sattappatittho we must turn to the Tika, which says: “Sattapatiṭṭhoti bhūmiphusanakehi vāladhi, varaṅgaṃ, hatthoti imehi ca tīhi, catūhi pādehi cāti sattahi avayavehi patiṭṭhitattā sattapatiṭṭho”. So, the elephant treasure touched the ground with his trunk, tail, penis (! varaṅga indeed) and four feet.",
  "mn129:37.2": "munjakesa is curious, and I cannot find a mythic explanation. Comm says: suṭṭhu kappetvā ṭhapitehi viya muñjasadisehi saṇhavaṭṭaujugatehi kesehi samannāgatattā muñjakeso",
