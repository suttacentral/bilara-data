  "mn12:29.6": "BB has “many hundreds of assemblies” but at AN 8.69 he changes it to “an assembly consisting of many hundreds”",
  "mn12:38.3": "BB has ’etremely', but text (here and PTS) omits ekanta.",
  "mn12:39.8": "Judging from this metaphor, did the Buddha visit Australia?",
  "mn12:47.3": "I’m not sure that BB’s “in the crevices” here makes sense. If they’re inn a crevice, would you just step over them? At AN 10.21 the identical phrase in a different context is rendered, “let me not harm small creatures that cross my path”. It’s interesting that the thoughts of the ascetic and the lion are the same.",
  "mn12:49.3": "Mahavikata is a Vinaya term for these things when eaten, i.e. the phrase doesn’t mean “distortion in eating “but” eating of distorted things”.",
  "mn12:52.6": "BB’s “make” is incorrect, there is no insinuation that they made these themselves.",
  "mn12:52.7": "I’m not convinced by BB’s “per day” here, there is no āha."
