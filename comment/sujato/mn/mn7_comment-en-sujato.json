  "mn7:19.6": "BB has “liberation”, obviously following PTS in reading “mokkhasammata”. This reading is supported by MA 93, which has 度相. (The other Chinese parallel at T 51 doesn’t have a close parallel with this phrase.) However the comm evidently reads lokkha: Tattha lokkhasammatāti lūkhabhāvasammatā, lūkhabhāvanti cokkhabhāvaṃ, visuddhibhāvaṃ detīti evaṃ sammatāti vuttaṃ hoti. The problem is that lokkha gives the exact opposite sense: rough or dirty. Nor does there appear to be any supporting sense in Sanskrit. The PTS dict suggests reading cokkha=clean here: https://suttacentral.net/define/cokkha, and I think this is the best reading. Liberation doesn’t fit the imagery of the text. Nor, so far as I know, was it generally held among the brahmins that liberation came from bathing alone. On the contrary, it is precisely those brahmins who developed the notion of liberation who insisted on the inner understanding. I suspect the Chinese translation, therefore, is a normalization, as is the reading mokkha in the Pali."
