  "mn47:10.6": "BB and Horner follow comm in rendering sugata/duggata as “well behaved”. But it is not clear that it can have this sense, I cannot find any other source. Normally they mean “in a sorry state or good state”, “poor and prosperous”, eg SN 15.11, Thig 5.12, AN 5.200, DN 33. Now, out current sentence starts with “whether in a Sangha or alone”. So whoever this is talking about, it cannot refer to “practice” in the strict sense, as it must include local villagers. Of course it can still refer to general behavior. But I see no reason to depart from the normal sense. MA 186 just has a regular term for sugata here (善逝) so that is no help.",

  "mn47:14.2": "Cp. AN 5.180",
  "mn47:16.1": "BB uses “reason” for akara in both its occurrences here. But imehi ākārehi imehi padehi imehi byañjanehi is a stock phrase, which in AN he renders “in this way, in these terms and phrases”.",
  "mn47:16.2": "The two parallels for this passage, at SN 48.42, and DN 27, both lack ayaṃ vuccati, bhikkhave, ākāravatī saddhā dassanamūlikā. Thus dalha is connected with asamhariya, contra MS text and BB’s translation, which makes better sense anyway.",
  "mn47:16.4": "The phrasing of these last lines are odd, and no translation I have consulted accounts for the pana. I think the sense is that, while one should do an investigation as described in the sutta, the real test is the test of Dhamma, which the Buddha has already proven himself against."
