  "mn72:15.9": "Mathita seems to only occur here in this sense. BB and Thanissaro have excogitations, which, apart from being obscure, has the wrong sense: “To consider or think (something) out carefully and thoroughly.” Horner has “supposing”, apparently taking it as a straight synonym for mannati. But at Thag 14.2 it clearly means “oppressed, weighed down”, and the same sense probably applies at Thag 1.102, too. So “burdens, anxieties, worries”."
