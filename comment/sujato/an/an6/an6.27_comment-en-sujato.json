  "an6.27:7.1": "BB has “object” for nimitta: “what object to rely on and attend to in order to attain …” But there is no such thing as a meditation “object” in early Buddhism. A nimitta is the very antithesis of an object; it is constantly associated with saññā, with perception, with ways of seeing, with aspects of things. To focus on a nimitta is to pay attention to that aspect of experience, especially meditative experience, that fosters and grows the requisite qualities, **together with the attending mind**, not as an object of it. The idiom yaṃ nimittaṃ āgamma yaṃ nimittaṃ manasikaroto recurs at MN 20, where BB renders it “when a bhikkhu is giving attention to some sign, and owing to that sign…” Nyanamoli had: “owing to some sign, to which sign he is giving attention”. BB’s more recent translation duplicates the sense of “owing to” (āgamma). I don’t try top capture the repeated yam, but try to capture the sense."
