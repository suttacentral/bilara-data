  "an6.29:4.1": "BB describes Ananda’s unusual choice of five recollections as “ironic”. But it’s not ironic. Ananda is, of course, well aware of the basic teaching on the six recollections. He’s showing off, giving a more advanced teaching, one that he knows the Buddha will approve of. And the Buddha, as in a number of similar exchanges (see MN 123), brings him back down to earth by calling attention to the basic practice of mindfulness.",
  "an6.29:6.2": "Here I note a few differences from BB’s list. Many of these are probably quite specialized terms, so using a few obscure terms is somewhat justified. Note that in some cases the exact definitions of these structures is vague and contested even in modern medicinal science. I have removed pleura as i think it is too specialized, I don’t see that the Pali must mean that particular set of membranes. For udariya see CPD. I use “feces” rather than excrement for karisa because, well, it has not been excreted. Synovial fluid is the correct term for lasika.",
  "an6.29:9.4": "terovassika literally means “over a year”. But in SN 35.231 it’s used of a tree, which must be many decades old before become decrepit."
