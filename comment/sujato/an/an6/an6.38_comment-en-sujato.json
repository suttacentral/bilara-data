  "an6.38:1.4": "BB has “there is no self-initiative; there is no initiative taken by others”. But I think this is unclear. Is it meant to imply that neither oneself has volition nor do others? If so, i don’t think this is what it means. It seems to me this is a statement of the classic problem of free will vs. determinism. Here it is denied that there is action from one’s own free will, “of one’s own volition”, as the standard idiom has it. Nor does one act by being instigated by others, (or, perhaps, by external conditions generally) i.e. the deterministic position.",
  "an6.38:1.6": "Kathañhi nāma is usually an expression of outrage or disbelief: “What the!”",
  "an6.38:2.1": "BB gives ārambha as reading here. Text has this at AN 1.11, with no vll. at either place."
