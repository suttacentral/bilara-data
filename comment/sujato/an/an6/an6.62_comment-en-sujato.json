  "an6.62:5.8": "This specific phrasing is shared with MN 136 and AN 6.62. In both cases, the context follows a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. I think the phrasing is meant to express a certain frustration, if I may dare to use such a term of the Buddha! The parsing of vibhajantassa is problematic, see BB’s note on AN 6.62.",
  "an6.62:10.15": "See BB’s note. He follows reading abhidose, however this reading is repeated in the next case, where it is impossible. I follow texts’ abhido, and take it as an idiom meaning “not-divided from”, i.e. “right by”, “virtually”, “nearly”. This meaning not found in the dictionaries."
