  "an6.55:4.4": "See discussion here: https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-so-a-and-tuning-instruments/2684 Also note that kammanna here wouldn’t really mean “easy to play”. A harp, unlike a guitar, doesn’t get harder to play if the strings are tight. It means “playable” as in “responsive, does what it should do”.",
  "an6.55:6.1": "I am not sure what guna means in this context. DOP says “string of a musical instrument” for this context, but why not continue using tanti for this? BB does not use string, but has “balanced pitch”, and I am unsure if he is explicitly rendering guna as “pitch” or merely translating the overall sense. “Pitch” would seem to be a possible reading for guna, but i can’t find it attested anywhere. The normal word would be yama. Perhaps it is simply a more vague phrase, “fixed at an even quality”.",
  "an6.55:7.2": "I think BB’s “balanced” is wrong for samatha. It occurs very commonly, of course, and it always means “settle”, not “balance”. Moreover at AN 6.116 we have Uddhaccassa pahānāya samatho bhāvetabbo, which repeates a familiar theme, that samatha abandons restlessness, i.e. the problem mentioned in the previous sentence. So I take it as a dvanda with samatha in its normal meaning. And as always, nimitta never means “object” or anything like it. This phrase means that one should understand this principle in terms of cause and effect, so that you know what to do.",
  "an6.55:11.2": "saddhamattaka is consistently used in a diminutive sense, “mere faith”, as contrasted with saddhamatta “a degree of faith”. The latter is sufficient for one to progress in the path (MN 22, SN 55.24), but with the former one just gets by (MN 65)."
