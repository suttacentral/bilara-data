  "an6.34:2.6": "This passage shows that the seat “prepared “or” made ready” doesn’t quite capture pannatta. It seems closer to the basic meaning of the word, “designated, appointed”. The point here is not that the gods had a seat ready for the Buddha all the time, but they were being polite by indicating which seat was for him."
