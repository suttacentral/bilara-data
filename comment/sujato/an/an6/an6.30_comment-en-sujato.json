  "an6.30:3.2": "Vina is usually translated as lute. But the ancient vina is more likely to be an instrument of the arched harp family. These are more closely derived from a bow. Arched harps are visible in several coins of Samudragupta, about 700 years after the Buddha. http://coinindia.com/galleries-samudragupta.html. These are similar to the Saung https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saung, a very ancient instrument still used in Burma."
