  "an4.111:1.5": "Notice how BB’s tranl. first uses “discipline” (which implies punishment), then “submit” for upeti. The combination implies a forcefulness that’s absent in the Pali. Vinaya doesn’t imply punishment, so “guidance” is better; and upeti means more to “fit in, go along with, comply” rather than submit, which again implies force. The inappropriateness of this implication is heightened here, because of course some forms of guidance are specifically said to be “gentle”.",
  "an4.111:4.3": "kappati in this sense is not common in the suttas. Compare SN 42.10. I’m not convinced that BB’s “allowable” is appropriate outside of a Vinaya context: who tells the Buddha what he’s “allowed” to do?"
