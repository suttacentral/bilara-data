  "an4.39:3.2": "It’s curiously difficult to find meaningful info on these. The sammapasa seems to mean (following MW) the “casting” “prasa” of a “stick” “samya” as part of a ritual. Perhaps “javelin throwing?” Vajapeya is a high royal rite of autumn, see http://advaita-l.advaita-vedanta.narkive.com/AmaMNXZP/vajapeya-fwd. I can’t find any reference to niraggala. I don’t agree with the defn. in the PPN. Perhaps it refers to a sacrifice performed outdoors, or even something like a bullfight: relase the animals before killing them."
