  "an4.61:13.5": "When the phrase puttadara is resolved, as at SN 3.10, dara is plural. Also note that this kind of context shows that putta is by default “children” and should be translated as “son” only when required by the context.",
  "an4.61:13.7": "BB’s rendering of this is verbose, and much of it is a paraphrase of the comms. The idiom is hard to capture, not because the words are obscure but because they are too common and ambiguous. I take “pattagata” to mean “what has been gotten”, i.e. possessions. I take “thanagata” as a synonym. ayatanaso is “within means or scope”, i.e. suitable."
