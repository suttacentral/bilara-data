  "an4.198:7.9": "For rajapatha, see MN 5, where it means a dirty, dusty place inside a house, an attic or similar.",
  "an4.198:8.3": "Note the apparently unique reading virato asaddhammā gāmadhammā, as opposed to the standard virato methunā gāmadhammā. No variant is recorded here, and none in PTS, which has the standard reading only. At https://suttacentral.net/pi/mnd7 asadhamma is a gloss on methuna, so presumably this reading has slipped in from a commentary."
