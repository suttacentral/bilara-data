  "an4.117:1.1": "Attarūpa is not obvious. Literally it would be “like oneself, ones’ own type”. BB follows the comm, but note that he follows the comms secondary expln, “by one who desires his own benefit”, which the comm itself says is the “meaning”, i.e. the interpretation rather than the gloss. The term appears in, so far as I know, three cases in the Suttas. At SN 35.117 it appears in precisely the same context as here, except the Buddha applies it to himself and the monks. In DN 27, however, it is used in a different context, transl. by RD as “characteristic”, as in “the abuse characteristic of the brahmins”, which I think is correct. In this case “for your own benefit” cannot be right. So here the comm omits this interpretation and merely gives the primary gloss: attano anurūpāya “conforming to one’s own nature”. What I think it means is that there are characteristic or individual ways of doing things, and we have to practice in accord with that. That’s what the Buddha is teaching the monks at SN 35.117: they have to find what works for them. Lit. the sentence would be: “By one who conforms with their own nature, diligence, mindfulness, and guarding of the mind are to be practiced …”"
