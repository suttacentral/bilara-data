  "an4.6:1.6": "I discussed these in some detail in A History of Mindfulness. SUTTA=statement: Normally all of these fall within the Suttas, so clearly sutta here has a narrower meaning. In Indic use generally it means “short doctrinal statement, epitome”, and that use is found in Buddhism too, eg the patimokkha is called the sutta. GEYYA=song: The comm explains as mixed prose and vers, hence BB’s trans. May well be correct, but the word can only mean “song”. VEYYAKARANA: the normal meaning of vyakarana is “answer”, and discourses in Q&A format are very common, in fact almost everything longer than a basic “statement” is in this form. BB’s “exposition” is misleading, as an exposition is essentially a long monologue, which is quite rare, and in any case it’s not what vyakarana means. GATHA: Thera-Theri, etc UDANA: possibly includes Dhammapada ITIVUTTAKA: BB has “quotation”, which is literal. But i suspect it actually means “legend”, i.e tales of the past, “so it was said…”. cf. itihāsa JATAKA and ABBHUTADHAMMA are uncontroversial. VEDALLA: BB has Q&A, but there are only a couple of explicit Vedallas, and lots of Q&As. Anyway, vyakarana literally means answer, while vedalla means “vi-dala”, to split apart, i.e to analyse."
