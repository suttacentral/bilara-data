  "an4.21:2.2": "The term rahogata is rendered by BB as “alone “, but it doesn’t quite mean that. In the Vinaya, one may be “rahogata” with a member of the opposite sex, where it is” private to the eye and ear”.",
  "an4.21:2.4": "BB has the more literal “live in dependence on”. the term is more normally used for the town that an ascetic lives near. Like many upa-words, it conveys something of “closeness”, a certain warmth. As an accomplished, mature man, to say that he would live “as a dependent” is too strong. What’s conveyed is more of a sense of mentorship, someone who you can turn to when you need, not someone you necessarily “depend” on in the narrow sense.",
  "an4.21:11.4": "It is tempting to read buddhanusasana, but contexts sch as this and AN 5.78 show that it must refer to all Buddhas."
