  "an4.66:4.4": "A knotty couplet. BB follows the comms here, but I’m not convinced. His use of “nature” follows the comm “sabhāva”, which is the gloss for santa. But the idea of an essential “own nature” is alien to the suttas, and I think it is the opposite of what’s intended. It’s not that they somehow “are” like this, it’s that when they act out these “dhammas” (correctly, I think, identified in the comms as “lust and so on” ) they become the person that they’ve created."
