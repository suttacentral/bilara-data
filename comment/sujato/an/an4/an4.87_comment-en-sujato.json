  "an4.87:5.5": "parihara often means to take care, eg of a child. As for opakkamika, BB has “assault” here, but in MN 14 he has “excessive striving” eg by the Jains. Since both contexts deal with the causes of painful feelings and are spoken in the Jain context, it’s unlikely that they have completely different meanings. In MN 14 etc it clearly means “caused by (too much) striving”, which in a more general context is “overwork”."
