  "an9.35:1.1": "Note that akettannu is only used twice in the EBTs, here and AN6.57. Since here it clearly has aliteral sense, I think this should be retained; it’s not a commn term that has escaped its metaphor.",
  "an9.35:1.11": "BB’s translation here misses the mark. Nimitta is not object, and never is. Nor is it the “sign” of meditation as translated by Hare. Thanissaro’s “theme” is a little better, but still misses the point. In meditation contexts, the nimitta is the cause, basis, or foundation for other qualities to grow. In this case, the first jhana is the **foundation** for developing the second jhana. Moreover, BB’s translation of other terms here is not ideal. “Pursues” for asevati sounds like the meditator is running after to to catch up! But it just means “repeat, practice, do again and again”. Finally, “focus”, rarely an ideal choice for adhitthati, misses the mark once more. The most common connotation is “decision, certainty”. It’s added here in double emphasis to show that the meditator is “sure” and “fixed” in the first jhana before proceeding to the next."
