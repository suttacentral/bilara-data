  "an9.4:3.2": "BB translates as singular. Sometimes the plural is intended as a formal usage, but here it seems he is speaking on behalf of all the monks present. Note that in the next sentence “speak” is singular.",
  "an9.4:5.1": "See BB’s note. Other editions have the expected cetosamathassa.",
  "an9.4:9.4": "BB follows PTS edition in amending satthu to sattha, despite little manuscript support. It seems to me satthu makes more sense. The sutta began by the Buddha showing his respect and appreciation for a monk who was teaching."
