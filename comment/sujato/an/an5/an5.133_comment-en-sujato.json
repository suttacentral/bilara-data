  "an5.133:3.1": "Note the curious inconsistency in how the peyyalas are handled in different occurrences of this passage.",
  "an5.133:4.6": "Gamanigama in MN 81 clearly refers to a single town, which PTS dict says means “market town”. Throughout the canon, gamam va nigamam va commonly means “village or town”, and the same sense should apply to longer compounds such as gamanigamarajadhani. However, there seems no reason why the few instances of gamanigama should not be interpreted consistently as “market town”, or perhaps simply as “town”."
