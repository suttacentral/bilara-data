  "an5.272:3.1": "BB has “sent” for peseti, which is literal, but obscure to me. What it presumably means is that even if they have been appointed to the office, you should avoid asking them to actually do their job. I don’t think it’s found in Vinaya. “Employ” would work, but has different connotations these days. There might be a literal component of “sending”, i.e. to families to make arrangements. But I don’t see how this would be a general sense of their task as a whole: mostly it would be organizing who goes where. In Sanskrit praiṣa (MW) has: sending, direction, invitation, summons, order, call (especially upon the assistant priest to commence a ceremony). It seems to me that this is similar to the last meaning: calling on an appointed functionary to do their job."
