  "an5.142:1.3": "Note unusual use of arabhati here.",
  "an5.142:6.4": "For some reason BB omits translating ayasma in this passage, which is the only thing that makes it clear we’re talking about mendicants here. Also see his note, which quotes without comment from the Comm, explaining “citta “as” vipassanacitta”. This is, of course, the exact opposite of the meaning. The text is obviously structured on sila, samadhi, panna, where citta, as is very common, is a synonym for samadhi. This is an excellent example of why it’s best to avoid the commentary’s doctrinal explanations whenever possible: they just add unnecessary confusion by inserting their own special doctrines in the text."
