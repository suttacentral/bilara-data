  "an5.54:5.2": "BB follows the comm in translating parikkhepa (see his note). But in the Vinaya it always has a meaning of “enclosure”, typically a fence that surrounds a monastery or village. It makes perfect sense here, either literally, with a sanghakamma that restricts movement as contrasted with pariccaja as expulsion, or else as “shutting down” in argument."
