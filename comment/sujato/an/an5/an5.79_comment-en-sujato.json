  "an5.79:2.2": "Bhavitakaya is explained in MN 36 as ability to endure pain, and also in the same sense at Pe 2.",
  "an5.79:2.9": "Notice how vinaya is used in this sutta. A sudent is “vinaya-ed” in sila, citta, panna, i.e. “guided”, not “disciplined”. How do we keep the connection between that “vinaya” and this? If we use “vinaya” here, we give the impression that we’re talking about the Vinayapitaka, but that’s clearly not so. Here, the difference between “dhamma” and “vinaya” is, it seems, “theory and practice”.",
  "an5.79:4.2": "Here kaṇhadhamma means, I think, both that you get into unskillful states of mind and that these influence the teachings."
