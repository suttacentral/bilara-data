  "an5.162:6.4": "BB has “leader of the village district”, which seems unlikely in the context. gāmantanāyaka is not glossed and doesn’t appear elsewhere. The Chinese text doesn’t, so far as I can tell, have anything closely corresponding to this phrase. Notice also that here, gamanta must mean “village”, not “outskirts of a village”, as usually rendered by BB in AN."
