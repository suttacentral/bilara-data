  "an5.191:0.2": "I’m puzzled at why BB calls this “Dogs”. All editions I’ve seen call it “brahmana”, with no variant readings.",
  "an5.191:2.1": "See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/menstruation-and-fertility-in-the-pali-texts/3042",
  "an5.191:3.1": "Note that the similar passage in Snp 2.7 explicitly adds “mutual consent”.",
  "an5.191:3.2": "See BB’s note for the readings. I find it very strange that brahmins are said to buy and sell brahmin women: I am not aware of this being said elsewhere. I suspect it stems from a misinterpretation of Brihadarannyaka 6.4, which parallels this very closely, where a brahman is encouraged to bribe his wife for sex when need be, using the same verb kinati. It doesn’t refer to buying a wife, certainly not selling her.",
  "an5.191:3.3": "“Love” is odd here, but it seems to me that “sampiya” is no less odd.",
  "an5.191:4.1": "The importance of this as an ethical principle for the ancients perhaps hints at the nomadic pastoral origins of the Indo-European peoples."
