  "an5.26:1.1": "BB follows the comm in translating ayatana as base (=cause=karana). But the “ayatana” doesn’t “cause” liberation, it is an opportunity for it. The root of ayatana means an extended or stretched out space, i.e. field, region, scope. Here it refers to the “occasion” or “opportunity” within which liberation can happen. Notice how the text uses the locative yattha, tranls. by BB as instrumental “by means of which”. Sure, there’s plenty of places where that works. But here there’s no need.",
  "an5.26:2.3": "BB understands yathā yathā … tathā tathā as indicating specificity. But I don’t understand how that works: how do you experience joy in the same way that something is taught? Instead I take it in a distributive sense."
