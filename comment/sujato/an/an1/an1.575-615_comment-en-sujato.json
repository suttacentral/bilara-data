  "an1.576-582:1.1": "Yogakkhema is a hard idiom to get right. I agree with the theory of Witzel, who traces it to an “oasis”, deriving from the very old days of the Indo-euopean wanderers. They’d trudge through the desert and hardlands, and after a very long time they’d come to a lake, an oasis, with grass for the cattle and horses, and shade and water. There they’d stop for the night, make a safe place, and find relief both for themselves and their beasts. This meaning is still prominent in the Jatakas, where a number of the old, mythic Jatakas features a lake Khema that is a sanctuary for living creatures. I translate directly as sanctuary, and use “sanctuary from the yoke” or similar when need in context.",
  "an1.587-588:1.1": "BB has “differentiation by wisdom” for paññāpabhedāya, but at Snp 1112 avijjāya pabhedana clearly means the “breaking up of ignorance”."
