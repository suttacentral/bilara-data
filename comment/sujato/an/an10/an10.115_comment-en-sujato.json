  "an10.115:2.1": "This idiom normally refers to thought, and is a little out of place here.",
  "an10.115:8.2": "BB has “And so it is with you” for evam sampamidam. But here sampada has the sense of “outcome, consequence”. This is an idiom always used in a context where someone has done something ill-advised, and has to deal with the consequences. Lit: “Such is the consequence for the venerables”. Idiomatically: “That’s what you get.”",
  "an10.115:9.6": "This is an oddly difficult idiom. Compare with the “if” version at, say MN 75. Here BB has “without finding it troublesome”. Which is fine, but it seems to me the point of this version, as opposed to the if version, is that it returns agency to the addressee. It’s inviting them to give an unburdensome explanation. Literally it would be “making it unproblematic [for you]”, i.e. “without making a problem out of it.” But that sounds passive-aggressive, while the Pali is deferential and polite. It’s like a combination of “take it easy “and” keep it simple”. “if you don’t mind” is not really exact, but it is the only way I can see to keep the phrase as it should be, a minor politeism."
