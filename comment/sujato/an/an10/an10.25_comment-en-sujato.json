  "an10.25:0.4": "BB perpetuates the mistake that kasina means “disk” in the suttas. It does not, as should be obvious from this sutta. It means “universal”. The root means “universal, totality”. It is not a term for the physical object on which meditation is based, but for the “universal, non-dual, measureless” state of mind produced by meditation. As such it is virtually a synonym for samadhi, but used in a more specific sense.sc1pts-vp-pli5.46"
