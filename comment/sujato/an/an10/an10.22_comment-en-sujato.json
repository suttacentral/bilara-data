  "an10.22:2.4": "BB’s “these things and those things” misses the point. Rather than specific cases—this or that—the understanding based on principle is universal, and hence surpasses the previous particular knowledges. Compare SN 1.26 where the light of a fire is better than that of the sun and moon in that it is universal, i.e. shines by day or night."
