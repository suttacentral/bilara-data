  "an10.69:1.2": "BB’s “speculations about the world and sea” might be a little harsh. Apart from this passage, it seems to appear only else elsewhere, in Mil 6.3.10. There it is said that the lokakkhayikas don’t describe the size of the ocean, the numbers of creatures there, and so on. So it seems they refrained from speculation!",
  "an10.69:5.1": "Note the idiom shifts from the standard anuyutta viharati to upadayupadaya, an unusual phrase, which however is not reflected in BB’s rendering. the correct sense of the idiom is clear from MN 12, where it means to bring up questions again and again, to continuously question. See also AN 8.8."
