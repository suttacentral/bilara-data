  "an10.27:3.2": "This is a not very good quote from AN 7.61. The text there supports BB’s suggestion that the singular here serves for the plural. However, also note that BB uses phenomena for dhamma here and things there. In this case, I understand dhamma to include “phenomena “and” principles”, so “things” is better.",
  "an10.27:9.2": "This is an odd sutta. Normally the Buddha gives a straight answer to a question, but here he gives a long winded discourse, which itself doesn’t seem particularly coherent, and which doesn’t seem to address the question at all."
