  "an10.45:0.4": "I use harem as more specific than the vague euphemism “inner palace”. Interestingly enough, though, the roots of the word harem is “forbidden”, i.e. taboo. Access to the harem was strcitly forbidden in Islamic courts. Here, though, it seems that it was considered normal for even a monk to enter the harem, and the reasons for not doing so are entirely practical, not magical or spiritual."
