  "an10.29:2.1": "BB’s translation here implies that the world of the sun and moon is the extent of a thousand suns and moons, which cannot be correct, and contradicts his translation at AN 3.80. https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/on-the-travels-of-the-gods-and-the-sun-and-moon/4086",
  "an10.29:13.2": "The identification of osadhitaraka is not straightforward. In Sanskrit it seems to mean only “moon”. And in the stock Pali phrase Obhāsentī disā sabbā, osadhī viya tārakā it seems unlikely the morning star is meant, more likely the moon. This is strongly connected with the healing power of herbs, especially the soma. However in MN 79 and MN80 we find the osadhitaraka mentioned in a list of ascending brightness, from a fire, to the osadhi to the moon, to the sun. That the osadhi is said to shine towards dawn strengthens the identification with Venus; the Chinese parallels confirm this. However at SN 2.29 a similar sequence of ascending brightness appears, which omits canda. And at Iti 27 the osadhi is placed awkwardly after the moon and sun.",
