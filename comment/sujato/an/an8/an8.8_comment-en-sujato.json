  "an8.8:1.1": "This place is, so far as I know, otherwise unknown. Uttara is a common name and it’s not clear if this is the same person as any of the others of the same name. Given the unusual setting, the lack of mention of the Buddha, the unusually fantastic setting—especially for such a prosaic teaching—the belabored repetition, and the incongruous last paragraph, this is clearly a late sutta. Perhaps this Uttara should be identified with the Uttara who was Revata’s student at the Second Council.",
  "an8.8:5.7": "BB’s “discernment” is here, as always, ill fitting for patibhana.",
  "an8.8:13.1": "Note the unusual vocative here, not found previously in this text."
