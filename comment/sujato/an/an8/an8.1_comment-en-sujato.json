  "an8.1:5.1": "i don’t think “sage” fits isi well here. It seems to me the earliest meaning of the term is something like “man of power, chosen one”, which I draw on here. By the time of the suttas it already comes to connotate a legendary figure.",
  "an8.1:5.2": "BB has “performing sacrifices”. But yajamana refers to those, usually khattiyas as here, who sponsor the sacrifice, not the brahmins performing it. See Olivelle, Early Upanishads, p. 16."
