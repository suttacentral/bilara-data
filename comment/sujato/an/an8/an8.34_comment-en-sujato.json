  "an8.34:1.1": "I feel BB’s translation misses the mark a little here. He translates as if it were an actual fruit field, but there following paragraph, with its irrigation, sounds more like rice. Mahaphala is used so generally there’s no need for it to mean literal fruit. Assada too is most commonly used in a derived sense. Finally, I prefer to avoid rendering phatiseyya with “profit”, as most fields in those days were for subsistence, not the market."
