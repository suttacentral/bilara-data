  "an8.11:1.3": "BB and Brahmali have “brahmin of Veranja”. But the normal connective form is Veranjaka. (MN 42). He would have been a brahmin known after his town, a common convention even today.",
  "an8.11:4.1": "BB translates the commentary with his “convivial”. Horner, followed by Brahmali, have “enjoyment”. But nibbhoga is always used in the sense of “useless, abandoned”. SN 7.14 “Assova jiṇṇo nibbhogo,” Pv 12, Ja 354 “Evaṃ sarīre nibbhoge, pete kālaṅkate sati”. Here it probably means “has no use for polite standards”, thus similar to the previous. We can maintain the pun by using indelicate here and delight below.",
  "an8.11:5.4": "This is parallel to AN 2.32",
  "an8.11:10.1": "BB follows comm in seeing apagabbha as a pun between a-pagabbha and apa-gabbha. But the negative for pagabbha is appagabbha, and moreover it’s always used in a positive sense. In the other terms used in this list, the Buddha shifts the meaning of the word, but he doesn’t invoke an entirely different word. I think it’s best to follow CPD and simply see it as a term of abuse."
