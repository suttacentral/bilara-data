  "an8.19:5.2": "BB has designation'for gotta, but I think the point here is that the text is, in fact, a little incongruous. In the Upanishadic passage this is presumably derived from, it has “namarupa”, which makes better sense.",
  "an8.19:8.1": "Here and in some other places, BB has lapus lazuli for veluriya. This seems unlikely, however. LL is defined by a strong blue color and dull luster, which are not characteristics of veluriya. Rather veluriya is typically described as transparent, gleaming, and shiny, which sounds like beryl."
