  "an8.29:1.1": "The phrase Khaṇakicco loko means something like “the world’s chance has come”. BB renders “the world has gained the oppurtunity”. But the phrase is explicitly presented as being a meaningless slogan, a bit of worldly wisdom. I’ve chosen to render it more idiomatically, using a famous political slogan.",
  "an8.29:17.1": "The next twelve lines are difficult, and I am not at all confident about them. PTS, followed by Hare, punctuates as if they are two verses of six lines. MS, and also BB, treat as three verses of four lines. However neither the text or BB’s translation seem coherent to me if construed in this way. So I have followed the PTS convention, which at least allows a meaningful translation.",
  "an8.29:18.1": "There are multiple readings fro paccavidum. I follow the text here."
