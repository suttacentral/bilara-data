  "an7.7:2.4": "BB’s “units of minted gold” is a terribly artificial idiom for a common term. Despite occurring frequently, there is little in the suttas to distinguish hiranna from suvanna. However Mnd 1 says hiraññaṃ vuccati kahāpaṇoti. On the whole, suvanna seems to be used widely for natural gold and golden things, hiranna is less common and is most characteristically used, as here, when reckoning wealth, eg Cīvaracetāpannaṃ nāma hiraññaṃ vā suvaṇṇaṃ vā muttā vā maṇi vā; Natthi me, āvuso, hiraññassa paṭivīso, nāhaṃ hiraññaṃ sādiyāmī; Khettaṃ vatthuṃ hiraññaṃ vā, gavāssaṃ dāsaporisaṃ; Asīti sakaṭavāhānaṃ, hiraññassa ahosi me; Pahūtaṃ me jātarūpaṃ, muttā veḷuriyā; Vaṇijjā tādisī natthi, hiraññena kayākayaṃ; Na pasū brāhmaṇānāsuṃ, na hiraññaṃ na dhāniyaṃ. However, also consider the Hirannavati River, i.e. river with gold (nuggets or dust).",
  "an7.7:4.3": "BB says these verses are identical with AN 7.5, however these two lines are different."
