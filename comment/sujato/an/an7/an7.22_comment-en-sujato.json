  "an7.22:12.3": "BB has “treachery” for upalapana, but this is incorrect. The term appears a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of “persuade, get close to and speak”. (eg Pc 70) It can be in a negative sense (Pj 4), or else it is enjoined on the monks as a way of getting good monks to stay (Kd 2). The outcome, of course, may well be treachery, but that’s not what the word means. It could be intended in a purely positive sense."
