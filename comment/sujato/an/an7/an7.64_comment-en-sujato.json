  "an7.64:1.7": "I think kappitaka refers to the complex hairdos of the time, not a mere trim: http://www.kalacakra.org/mandala/sanchi2.jpg",
  "an7.64:9.1": "For these difficult verses, in addition to BB, I have consulted Nyanamoli’s more poetic rendering (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.nymo.html) as well as Thanissaro (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.060.than.html).",
  "an7.64:14.1": "I am not at all confident of these lines. I think this is what it means, but i admit I can’t completely justify it. BB has “When an angry person causes damage/whether easily or with difficulty”, Nyanamoli has “Someone a man in anger hurts;/But, when his anger is later spent/With difficulty or with ease,”. But can we take viya to mean vā? Thanissaro has “He takes pleasure in bad deeds as if they were good,” evidently following Hare in reading uparoceti “A man in wrath finds pleasure in bad deeds/as in good deeds.”",
  "an7.64:15.4": "See BB’s note for the difficulties with this verse."
