  "an7.49:3.2": "On pubbenapara, see BB’s note. I don’t think it quite means “successive stages”, here or elsewhere. In all the contexts i’ve seen, it fits with the meaning of “as compared to how it was before”. See DN 26: Tassa samatena janapadaṃ pasāsato pubbenāparaṃ janapadā na pabbanti, yathā taṃ pubbakānaṃ rājūnaṃ ariye cakkavattivatte vattamānānaṃ. Also note the reading bhavanaphala found in PTS without variants, while here text says bhavanabala, also without variants."
