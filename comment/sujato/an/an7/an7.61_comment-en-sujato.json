  "an7.61:1.3": "It’s curious name, with many variants. I wonder whether it stands for kālavāḷaputta, the “son of the black monster”. It was common for villages to be named after the local deity who had a shrine there, eg Alavi. Children were, it seems, offered to some of the darker deities.",
  "an7.61:8.1": "BB translates pacchāpuresaññī as “what is behind you and what is in front”, which seems ti imply it is taken in a spatial sense, i.e. aware of the path before and after. However, the phrase frequently occurs in a temporal sense, where it emphasizes the continuity of perception: Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati—yathā pure tathā pacchā … Of course it could be a different contextual meaning. however the contexts share a lot in common. In those cases we find such expressions as appaṇihitaṃ me bahiddhā cittan’ti pajānāti. Atha pacchāpure ‘asaṅkhittaṃ vimuttaṃ appaṇihitan’ti pajānāti; na ca bahiddhā vikkhitto bhavissati. Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati It seems the phrase is used consistently to emphasize that attention is focussed constantly and internally as against the mind scattered externally.",
  "an7.61:10.2": "Bb uses a nice phrase for this very idiomatic phrase. But I’m not sure why he uses the plural here.",
  "an7.61:11.6": "BB’s phrasing here “bonding with no-one at all” doesn’t fit with the explanation, where it is places that are mentioned, not people."
