  "an7.70:1.2": "Throughout this sutta, text punctuates as if bhikkhu was a vocative, sariputta talking to himself. However compare AN 4.21, where it is the nominative, as translated by BB.",
  "an7.70:2.4": "I don’t think BB’s “nugget” for nikkha is correct.",
  "an7.70:6.2": "It’s unusual, if not unique for a monk to interpret the “Buddha’s” statement, whien in fact it was their own.",
  "an7.70:14.1": "This is one of those suttas whose elaborate repetitions overweigh the content to the extent that it becomes hard to discern the original pattern. The PTS edition, followed by BB, omits the “positive” turn of the cycle."
