  "an7.45:1.1": "BB has “accessories” for parikkhara, which is incorrect. An accessory is something optional, alankara in Pali. This is talking about things that are essential, not decorative. The normal meaning of parikkhara is, of course, the “necessities” of life, where once again it is employed in the sense of the things that make life possible, not those that make it fun."
