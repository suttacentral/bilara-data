  "an7.63:2.2": "Note BB follow’s PTS reading of an extra addha.",
  "an7.63:2.3": "The politics of the relations here are important. The word used is adiyati. This is used in the same sense in DN 32, where it refers to yakkhas rebelling against the gods, or bandits rebelling against the the king. So “obey” seems fine, perhaps we could use “submit”. Note that this is not a general problem, but specifically living under another’s roof. Note too that the relation with the Buddha is of respect, not obedience, and it is this that actually works!",
  "an7.63:3.2": "Note the Buddha’s usual style: deal directly with the person themselves in a respectful manner.",
  "an7.63:9.1": "Not sure why BB reads “elder brother” here. It seems to me it could be either “elders” or “elder sister”. The verse doesn’t appear elsewhere, and Comm says nothing. Hare has “elder born”.",
  "an7.63:14.3": "Yuk. Perhaps the most harmful sutta in the Pali canon. It unfortunately has several Chinese parallels, which, so far as a quick survey shows, all have her wanting to be a slave, and to consent to violence. I’ll go and have a little cry now."
