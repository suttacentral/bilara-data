  "an2.37:1.2": "Two completely different locations given. I have adopted the better attested one against the text.",
  "an2.38:2.2": "The parallel passage occurs at MN 125 and AN 2.38. MS text has kāmamajjhāvasati at AN 2.38 and kāmamajjhe vasanto at MN 125. BB has “living in the midst of sensual pleasures” at MN 125 and “dwells in sensual pleasures” at AN 2.38, with the note: “I follow Ce and Be kāmamajjhāvasati (= kāmaṃ ajjhāvasati), as against Ee kāmamajjhe vasati.” Notably, the first two terms in the sequence are reversed. the sequence in MN 125 makes better sense: it starts with where they live, what they do, what they think about, and gradually moves up to being consumed and seeking more. I take this as the correct sense and translate both passages accordingly.",
  "an2.38:2.3": "BB has “childish elder”, evidently not reading “na”."
