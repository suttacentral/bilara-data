  "an3.39:1.4": "From this it would appear that the nivasana is comparable to what bhikkhus call antaravasaka, i.e. a robe that covers the lower parts, worn indoors, i.e. a dhoti or sarong.",
  "an3.39:2.3": "bilanga is transl. as “sour gruel”, but why would you eat gruel with porridge, which, in fact, is just gruel. PTS dict. suggests Skt vidanga and vilanga, both of which are bitter medicial plants. It’s common today to eat gruel with pickle, and so I translate it. Concise dict has “vinegar”, which also fits."
