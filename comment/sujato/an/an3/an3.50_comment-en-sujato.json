  "an3.50:1.1": "Note: BB has “commits banditry” for ekagarika, but cf. MW: aikāgārika as, ī mf. (fr. ekâgāra • ekam asahāyam āgāram prayojanam asya, whose object is a solitary house), a thief Pāṇ. 5-1, 113 Daś. Śiś.; which agrees with pali comms “ekam eva gharaṁ parivāretvā vilumpanaṁ”, see CPD.",
  "an3.50:2.2": "Note: BB reads “gedha”, citing PTS, and translates “coppice”, but PTS only has gedha in this (dubious) case, and it says “cave” (=geha?). I can’t find anything to justify “coppice”. On the other hand, India is full of raised banks and ridges in paddies, perfect to hide behind, so “rodha” it is."
