  "an3.1:2.2": "Upaddava and upasagga appear at AN 3.1, in a parallel at MN 115, and upaddava recurs in related passages at MN 122 and SN 16.8. See too Ss 8. In each case they seem to be a synonym of bhaya in the sense of “danger”, which in both upaddava and upasagga is related to the basic sense of “being rushed upon by something”. At MN 122 it is better to read in this sense rather than “undoing”; the undoing comes later. Notably, both upaddava and upasagga are terms for an eclipse, and possibly convey an echo of “ill-omened”. I translate “peril “and” hazard”."
