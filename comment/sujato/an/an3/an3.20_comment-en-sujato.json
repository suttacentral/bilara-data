  "an3.20:3.3": "BB usually translates puttadāra and 'wife and children'. However when the compound is resolved, dāra is usually in plural, 'wives'. I render with the gender-neutral 'partner' except where the context is gendered. Also note that notions of marriage have always been more flexible in English than in Christian lands, and arrangements that we might consider defacto partnerships might also be known by the same terms."
