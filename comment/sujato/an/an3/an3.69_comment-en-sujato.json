  "an3.69:2.3": "When vadha and bandhana are used, as here, with janiya, etc. they refer to the acts of kings or other authorities and thus to be translated 'execution and imprisonment'. When used with chedana, etc. they refer to acts of bandits, hence 'murder and abduction'. Some contexts are ambiguous, and indeed conflate these two, in which case I use 'killing and caging'."
