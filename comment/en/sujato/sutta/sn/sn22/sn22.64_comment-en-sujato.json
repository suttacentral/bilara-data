  "sn22.64:1.4": "Maññati in such contexts means “think about in terms of a self”. Nyanamoli/Bodhi try to capture this with “conceive”, punning on “conceptualize/conceit”. But the pun is highly obscure without a detailed knowledge of the issues. Using “identify” I am trying to make the subtext clearer."
