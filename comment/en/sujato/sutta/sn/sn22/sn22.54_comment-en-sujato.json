  "sn22.54:1.2": "_Bījajāta_ are not “kinds of seeds” but “plants grown from seeds” ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc11]():  _Bhūtagāmo nāma pañca bījajātāni_). Similarly, _mūlabīja_ is not “root-seeds” but “plants grown from roots” such as ginger or turmeric. In this case, the SN commentary contradicts the Vinaya commentary.",
  "sn22.54:1.5": "_Sukhasayita_ doesn’t means “well-planted” per Bodhi here, for how could it be planted if there is no soil? It means “well-laid by”, i.e. well kept or well preserved, as Bodhi has in [an3.34]()."
