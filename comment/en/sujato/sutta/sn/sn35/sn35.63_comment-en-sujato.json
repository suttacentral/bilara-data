  "sn35.63:2.8": "The MS texts omits the ear, nose, body, and mind. It is common in the Saḷāyatanasaṁyutta for the ear, nose, and body to be omitted, leaving only eye, tongue, and mind (_mano_). The omission of _mano_ here must be a textual oversight, as it is included in the following round in this Sutta, and in both rounds of the next Sutta. _Mano_ is restored in the PTS and Buddha Jayanthi editions, which I follow here."
