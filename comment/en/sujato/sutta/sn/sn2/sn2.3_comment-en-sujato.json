  "sn2.3:3.4": "_Vatrabhū_ is the Pali spelling of Sanskrit _vṛtrahan_, “slayer of the Constrictor”. Vṛtra was a massive cobra whose defeat at the hands of Indra (i.e. Sakka, or as here, Māgha), was one of the primordial myths underlying the Vedas (eg. Rig Veda 1.32). Vṛtra held the waters imprisoned, and one reading is that he is the ice of the Himalayan snowy season, trapping the waters until they are released by the storms of Indra with the coming of the rainy season. Vṛtra was identified with wickedness (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.1.5.7). "
