  "sn56.8:1.1": "While this phrase is on the whole clearly a synonym for the previous sutta, the phrasing is interestingly different. The use of singular shows that _citta_ here means “mind state”, not “thought”; but since we are concerned with theories, we use “idea”. _Cinteti_ straddles the meaning of _vitakketi_ and _ceteti_ “intends”, which is quite nicely represented by the English idiom “(to) think (something) up”.
