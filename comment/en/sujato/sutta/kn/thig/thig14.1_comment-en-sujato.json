  "thig14.1:9.1": "Arthaśastra 2.13.51 describes how to alloy the  _tapanīya_ (“glittering gold”) that is ready to be worked. ",
  "thig14.1:10.4": "“Pixie” is _kinnarī_, this marking the only appearance of these charming woodland sprites in early Pali; but see the synonymous _kiṁpurisa_ at [an2.60:1.1](). They share with the _gandhabba_ the attributes of being divine musicians, sometimes half-horse (or later, half-bird), and being sensual lovers; but where the _gandhabba_ is associated with licentiousness, the _kinnara_ and _kinnarī_ live together as a perfect dyad of lovers, ever entranced with one another. They are spirits of nature, hidden in the mountains, and threatened by human encroachment ([ja485]()). Occasionally, however, a human tribe in the mountains of Kashmir is called Kinnara (= Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh?). | The beauty of the pixie’s eyes are praised at [ja458:1.3](), while the phrase “captivating eyes” (_mandalocana_) is used of a divine maiden at [dn21:1.5.26]().

  "thig14.1:31.1": "For _cārudassanā_, compare Sanskrit _cārulocanā_, “she whose eyes are fair”. [thig14.1:18.2]() above has already established the sense “eye” for _dassana_. ",
