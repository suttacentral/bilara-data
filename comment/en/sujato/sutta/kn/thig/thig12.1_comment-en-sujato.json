  "thig12.1:1.2": "Norman and Ṭhānissaro, evidently under the influence of the commentary, translate in present tense, but _udakamotariṁ_ is an aorist in past tense as is rendered by Mahendra. If the commentary is correct, she is telling a story from before she ordained. But both the brahmin’s respectful form of addresses (_bhoti_) and the boldness of her teachings suggest she was already a nun."
