  "thig2.3:1.1": "This verse is problematic and any translation is conjectural. I think that, like <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig1.11/en/sujato'>Thig 1.11</a>, it hinges on double entendres of kitchen drudgery and sex. The nun here is presumably the mother of the Sumaá¹…gala at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.43/en/sujato'>Thag 1.43</a>, whose verses are similar. "
