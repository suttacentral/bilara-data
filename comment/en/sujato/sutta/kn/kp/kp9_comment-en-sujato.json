  "kp9:6.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nikujjati</i> means to “turn upside down”, most familiar in the case of when the Sangha in extreme circumstances to “upturn the bowl” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pattaṁ nikujjati</i>).

I think the sense is that one should not turn away from or avert one’s gaze from another. "
