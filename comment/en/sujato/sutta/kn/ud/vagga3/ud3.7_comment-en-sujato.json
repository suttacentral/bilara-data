  "ud3.7:3.6": "I’m not sure if _anekarasabyañjano_ is correct, although the word does occur at [Pv 13:15.4](https://suttacentral.net/pv13/pli/ms#15.4) and [Pv 27:12.4](https://suttacentral.net/pv27/pli/ms#12.4). The commentary, while not definitive, suggests _anekasūpabyañjano_ (_anekehi sūpehi ceva byañjanehi ca_), which would be more idiomatic. However it is not attested. "
