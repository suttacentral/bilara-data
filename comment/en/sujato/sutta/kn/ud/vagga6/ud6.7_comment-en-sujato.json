  "ud6.7:4.4": "For “they never return” (_na jātu’m’eti_) there is a variant reading “go to rebirth” (_jātim eti_) in [Śarīrārthagāthā 32](https://suttacentral.net/sag/san/enomoto#sag32), which  here is very close to the Pali. The commentary also acknowledges this variant: _‘Na jāti metī’tipi paṭhanti, so evattho_. "
