  "ud6.1:3.2": "Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years. ",
  "ud6.1:17.1": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "ud6.1:17.2": "_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_. ",
  "ud6.1:17.4": "_Attasambhava_ here refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line. "
