  "ud2.7:5.1": "The PTS reading _piyarūpāsāta_ is tempting, and supported by the Udānavarga’s _priyarūpasātagrathitā_. The commentary reads _sukhavedanassādena_, which appears to support _assāda_. But perhaps originally _sāta_ was glossed with _sukhavedanā_, and _assāda_ was read back into the text by mistake."
