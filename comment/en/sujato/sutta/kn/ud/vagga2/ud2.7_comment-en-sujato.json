  "ud2.7:5.1": "The PTS reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>piyarūpāsāta</i> is tempting, and supported by the Udānavarga’s <i lang='pi' translate='no'>priyarūpasātagrathitā</i>. The commentary reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhavedanassādena</i>, which appears to support <i lang='pi' translate='no'>assāda</i>. But perhaps originally <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāta</i> was glossed with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhavedanā</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>assāda</i> was read back into the text by mistake.
