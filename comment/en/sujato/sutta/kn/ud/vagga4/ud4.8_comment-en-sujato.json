  "ud4.8:2.2": "Anandajoti has “venture”, Thanissaro has “dare”, but a similar phrase at pli-tv-kd8:12.1.5 clearly has the less pregnant sense of “able”, per Ireland. Comm: ussahasīti sakkosi",
  "ud4.8:2.4": "Accepting the variant, which is found in all similar passages. Reading, as Thanissaro and Anandajoti do, “what can I *not* do” is pleasingly dramatic, but not very idiomatic for Pali. Far more likely a simple reinforcement is meant. Comm ignores, implying it thought there was nothing to see.",
  "ud4.8:6.3": "The idiom _ime hi nāma_ appears mildly emphatic in a disparaging way. Compare _kathaṁ hi nāma_ just below."
