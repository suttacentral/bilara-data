  "ja16:1.1": "The deer attentively learns the ruses of deer. | I understand the first two lines as accusative of relation. ",
  "ja16:1.2": "Here _aṭṭha_ chimes with _aḍḍha_. Perhaps the sense is that the dainty tread of the cloven hooves make little sound. ",
  "ja16:1.4": "Here _kalā_ means “trick, deceit”. | _Chahi kalāhi_ here chimes with _sattahi kālāti_ in the previous verse. The “six tricks” are the three ways of playing dead, the eight hooves, sneaking a drink at midnight, and breathing through one nostril. How eight hooves is a ruse is unclear, but its central role suggests it was the kernel of the two verses. | Commentary takes _bhāgineyyo_ in its usual sense of “nephew”, but I think it is from _bhāgin_ by analogy with _dakkhiṇeyyo_, “one who deserves a share”.
