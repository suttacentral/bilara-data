  "ja16:1.1": "The deer attentively learns the ruses of deer. | I understand the first two lines as accusative of relation. ",
  "ja16:1.2": "Here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṭṭha</i> chimes with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍha</i>. Perhaps the sense is that the dainty tread of the cloven hooves make little sound. ",
  "ja16:1.4": "Here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kalā</i> means “trick, deceit”. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Chahi kalāhi</i> here chimes with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattahi kālāti</i> in the previous verse. The “six tricks” are the three ways of playing dead, the eight hooves, sneaking a drink at midnight, and breathing through one nostril. How eight hooves is a ruse is unclear, but its central role suggests it was the kernel of the two verses. | Commentary takes <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhāgineyyo</i> in its usual sense of “nephew”, but I think it is from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhāgin</i> by analogy with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dakkhiṇeyyo</i>, “one who deserves a share”.
