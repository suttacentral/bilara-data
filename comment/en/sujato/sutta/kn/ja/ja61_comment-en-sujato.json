  "ja61:1.1": "A young student is told by his mother that his education is incomplete until he learns the mysterious “spell of the unpleasant”. His teacher knows that there is no such spell, but realizes that the mother wants her son to learn of the wickedness of women. | Read _asā_ from _a_ + _sva_, “without an owner”, and hence “unclaimed” or “without a husband”. The commentary explains, rather, as _asatiyo_ (“false”) and also _asāta_ (“displeasing”). Perhaps the curious “spell of the unpleasant” was retroactively invented to explain this word. "
