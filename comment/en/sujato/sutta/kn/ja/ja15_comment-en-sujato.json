  "ja15:1.1": "The story tells how the Bodhisatta declared the deer unteachable after he failed to show up for lessons on the ruses of deer seven times. The verses and stories form a pair with the next Jātaka. Though the verses are in different metres, the prevalence of shared terms, ideas, and poetic play shows they must have been composed together. | The commentary takes <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kharādiye</i> as the vocative of  <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kharādiyā</i>, the name of the Bodhisatta’s sister. However, I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khara</i> as “ass, mule” and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ādiye</i> as second optative, “you should accept”. Asses have solid hooves, as opposed to the cloven-footed deer. ",
