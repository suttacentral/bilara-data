  "ja41:1.1": "After an act of jealousy towards an arahant in a distant past life, so the story goes, Mittaka’s bad character, as much as his bad kamma, resulted in a series of extravagant tragedies over many lives. ",
  "ja41:1.3": "Mittaka is called Mittavindaka in the past life story and Losaka Tissa in the story of the present. The name Losaka, otherwise unattested in Pali, is a patronymic stemming from Luśa Dhānāka of Rig Veda 10.35 and 10.36. ",
  "ja41:1.4": "The details of how he came to be hanging off a goat’s foot are absurd and too complex to relate here. The events collate several stories of the archetypal scapegoat type, subsuming this ancient mythic and ritual idea under the doctrine of kamma. In such cases, absurdity is used for humorous effect, but it also draws on the surreal and fantastical narratives that swirl around the Vedic ritual. The story likely began as an explanation for a detail of Vedic sacrifice. "
