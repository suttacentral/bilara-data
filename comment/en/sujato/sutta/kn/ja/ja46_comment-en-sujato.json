  "ja46:1.1": "A lazy groundskeeper asks the monkeys in the park to water the trees in his absence. They set to work with all good cheer. However, misconstruing the instructions, they pull up each tree to examine the size of the roots before watering, thus ruining the park despite their good intentions. ",
  "ja46:1.2": "The verse plays on two meanings of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i>. In the opening line, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i> is “meaning, basis” (as per <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.8/en/sujato#1.1'>Snp 1.8:1.1</a> or [an5.169:3.1]), and it is glossed <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatane kāraṇe</i> (“reason, cause”). Here it means “good, benefit” and is glossed <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vuḍḍhi</i> (“growth”). "
