  "ja62:1.1": "An innocent baby girl was sold into slavery and kept locked up under guard her entire life by a brahmin who married her. This was to feed his gambling addiction by refuting his adversary’s lucky charm, which was an asseveration of truth that all women were faithless. He started winning a dice, so his adversary employed a knave who, by cruelly deceiving her waiting-woman, managed to sneak in and seduce the wife. To help the knave make his escape, the young wife persuaded her husband to play the harp while she danced, asking him to cover his eyes for modesty’s sake. On discovering the ruse, the brahmin beat his wife and chased her away. Somehow, this is evidence that *women* can’t be trusted. "
