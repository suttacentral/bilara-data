  "ja62:1.1": "An innocent baby girl was sold into slavery and raised in confinement by a brahmin who then married her. This was to feed his gambling addiction by refuting his adversary’s lucky charm, which was an asseveration of truth that all women were faithless. His adversary employed a knave who first convinced the young wife’s waiting-woman that he was her son, then said he had fallen in love with the girl on hearing of her beauty. The matron snuck the knave in and he seduced the girl. To help the knave make his escape, the young wife persuaded her husband to play the harp while she danced, asking him to cover his eyes for modesty’s sake. On discovering the ruse, the brahmin beat his wife and chased her away. Somehow, this is evidence that *women* can’t be trusted. "
