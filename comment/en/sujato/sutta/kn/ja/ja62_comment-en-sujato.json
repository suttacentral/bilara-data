  "ja62:1.1": "An innocent baby girl was sold into slavery and raised in confinement by a man who then married her. All this was to feed his gambling addiction by making her the only faithful woman. His adversary employed a scoundrel who first convinced the young wife’s waiting-woman that he was her son, then said he had fallen in love with the girl on hearing of her beauty. The matron snuck the scoundrel in and he seduced the girl. So that the scoundrel could make his escape, the young wife persuaded her husband to play the harp while she danced, asking him to cover his eyes for modesty’s sake. On discovering the ruse, the brahmin beat his wife and chased her away. Somehow, this is evidence that *women* can’t be trusted. "
