  "ja62:1.1": "An innocent baby girl is sold into slavery and raised in confinement by a man who then marries her. All this is to feed his gambling addiction by making her the only faithful woman. His adversary employs a scoundrel who first convinces the young wife’s waiting-woman that he is her mother, then when she has formed an emotional attachment to him, he says he has fallen in love with the girl on hearing of her beauty. She snuck the scoundrel in and he seduced the girl. To leave, she persuaded her husband to play the harp while she danced, asking him to cover his eyes for modesty’s sake. "
