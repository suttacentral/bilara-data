  "ja71:1.1": "A lazy pupil takes a nap while others are gathering firewood. At the last moment, he carelessly snaps a green branch off the Warding Tree, hurting his eye in the process; and when it came time for breakfast, the fire would not light. ",
  "ja71:1.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Varaṇa</i> (or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>varuṇa</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Crateva religiosa</i>) is from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>var</i> “to ward”. It is associated with Vedic rites of the dead and with “warding off” demons, foes, and all manner of ills (Atharva Veda 10.3). Vedic ritualists were very particular about what wood was to be used for what purpose (eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.8.4.1), and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>varaṇa</i> wood, due to its association with the rites of death, was not to be used to make offerings in the life-giving Homa fire ritual (Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 1.6.7). The association of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>varaṇa</i> with death is maintained in the commentarial story behind <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja38/en/sujato'>Ja 38</a>, where the crane kills fish on a branch of this tree. This verse, I suggest, was originally a warning against using the wrong wood for the ritual. "
