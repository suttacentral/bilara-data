  "ja71:1.1": "A lazy pupil takes a nap while others are gathering firewood. At the last moment, he carelessly snaps off a green branch of the Warding Tree, hurting his eye in the process, and ruining the fire. ",
  "ja71:1.3": "The _varaṇa_ or _varuṇa_ tree—from the root _var_ “to ward”— is _Crateva religiosa_. In Vedic ritual it is associated with rites of the dead and with “warding off” demons, foes, and all manner of ills (Atharva Veda 10.3). Vedic ritualists were very particular about what wood was to be used for what purpose, and _varaṇa_ wood, due to its association with the inauspicious rites of death, was not to be used for the life-giving Homa fire offerings. The association of the _varaṇa_ with death is maintained in the commentarial story behind [ja38](), where the crane kills the fish on a branch of this tree. "
