  "ja64:1.1": "When a wife has been good, she expects her husband to be nice to her; but when she has been bad, she is nice to him. The complexity of these behaviors is evidently too much for her husband, who seeks counsel for his confusion. Rather than make an effort to understand his wife, he is advised to simply ignore her feelings. ",
  "ja64:1.3": "_Thīnaṁ_ is genitive plural, glossed _itthīnaṁ_. | The Dhamma is also “hard to understand” ([snp3.12:59.1]()). "
