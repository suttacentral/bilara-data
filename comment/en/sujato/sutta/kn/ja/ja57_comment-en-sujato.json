  "ja57:1.1": "A crocodile’s wife, being pregnant, conceives an irresistible craving (_dohaḷa_) to eat the heart of the monkey king. Her husband tries to satisfy her by pretending to be a rock in the river, but the monkey sees through his ruse. This is one of a cycle of _dohaḷa_ stories in the Jātakas, which deal with the ascension of consciousness. Here the ascension fails due to the crocodile’s greed and foolishness, so it cannot consume the monkey’s heart, i.e. intelligence. ",
  "ja57:1.2": "In legend, the _vānara_ is a race of aggressive human-like monkeys with long tails and hairy skin like blankets. Their leaders such as Sugrīva or Hanuman are titled “lord of langurs”. Such leaders are often found in artwork depicted as langurs, with their prominent sideburns lending them a decidedly human appearance. ",
  "ja57:1.4": "This last line plays on a double meaning. The commentary explains _diṭṭha_ as “foe” (Sanskrit _dviṣṭa_) and the phrase as “defeats the foe”. But the crocodile shuts his eyes and opens his mouth to catch the langur, pointing to the more common meaning of _diṭṭha_ as “seen” (Sanskrit _dṛṣṭa_), and yielding the sense, “transcends the seen”. The clever monkey defeats his enemy because he sees beyond mere appearances, while the crocodile is blinded by his greed. "
