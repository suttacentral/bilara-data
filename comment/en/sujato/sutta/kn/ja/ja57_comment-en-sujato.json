  "ja57:1.1": "A crocodile’s wife, being pregnant, conceives an irresistible craving (_dohaḷa_) to eat the heart of the monkey king. Her husband tries to satisfy her by tricking the monkey but is outsmarted. This is one of a cycle of _dohaḷa_ stories in the Jātakas, which deal with the ascension of consciousness. Here the ascension fails due to the crocodile’s greed and foolishness, so they cannot consume the monkey’s heart, i.e. intelligence. ",
  "ja57:1.2": "In legend, the _vānara_ is a race of aggressive human-like monkeys with long tails and hairy skin like blankets. Their leaders such as Sugrīva or Hanuman are titled “lord of langurs”. Such leaders are often found in artwork depicted as langurs, with their prominent sideburns lending them a decidedly human appearance. "
