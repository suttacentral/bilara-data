  "ja57:1.2": "In legend, the _vānara_ is a race of aggressive human-like monkeys with long tails and hairy skin like blankets. Their leaders such as Sugrīva or Hanuman are titled “lord of langurs”. Such leaders are often found in artwork depicted as langurs, with their prominent sideburns lending them a decidedly human appearance. "
