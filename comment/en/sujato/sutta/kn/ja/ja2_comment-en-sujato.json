  "ja2:1.2": "Resolve <i lang='pi' translate='no'>udaṅgaṇa</i> as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uda</i> (“water”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṅgaṇa</i>, from a root sense of “going”, from where we find the Sanskrit sense of “passage” (against the commentary, which says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uda</i> is a mere particle). In the prose story, the Bodhisatta, lost with his caravan in the desert, hears water rushing underground and urges a young man to dig. "
