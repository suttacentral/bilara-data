  "ja12:1.1": "The king was a meat-lover who hunted deer each day. The deer made a pact to offer one from each herd by lot. When the lot fell on a pregnant doe in Branch’s herd, that wicked deer-king insisted she give herself up, but Banyan intervened and went himself. Seeing the noble deer-king’s self-sacrifice, the king spared his life, the lives of all deer, and even the lives of the fishes and birds. | This Jātaka was analyzed by T.W. Rhys Davids in his *Buddhist India*, who pointed out that it is an instance where the verse is unintelligible without the story. The story is illustrated on the stupa at Barhut. "
