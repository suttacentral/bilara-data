  "ja5:1.1": "_Nāḷikā_ (“cup”) is literally a “tube” (of bamboo). [sn3.13:6.1]() shows that a _nāḷikā_ of rice was sufficient for a modest serving. ",
  "ja5:1.2": "The first two lines are spoken by horse traders, whose 500 horses were valued as a cup of rice. So they ask the king what is the value of a cup of rice when it comes to pricing horses. | The importance of correct valuation is attested by the detailed breakdowns in such texts as Arthaśāstra 2.19 and Manusmṛti 8.131–137. ",
  "ja5:1.4": "These two lines record the derision of the court when told that a cup of rice is worth Varanasi with its suburbs. Note that the prose story attributes the foolish valuations to a king’s valuer of whom the verse makes no mention. Taking the verse on its own, it would appear to be the king himself who makes the false valuation. "
