  "ja77:1.1": "King Pasenadi is perturbed by sixteen dreams, but the Buddha assures him that these do not affect him, but are portents of times to come. Each dream depicts an inversion or perversion of the just order of things. | Four snorting black bulls depart without fighting. | Sapling trees flower. | Cows suckle at newborn calves. | Oxen are unyoked and calves given the reins. ",
  "ja77:1.2": "A horse eats from two mouths. | People beg a jackal to defecate in a fine goblet. | A she-jackal eats a rope as it is being spun. | People pour water into a full pitcher. ",
  "ja77:1.3": "A lotus-pond is muddy in the middle and clear on the edges. | Rice will not cook. | People barter sour milk for sandalwood. ",
  "ja77:2.2": "Text reads _supaṇṇa_ (“phoenix”), but commentary reads _suvaṇṇa_ (“golden”), explaining as “golden royal geese” (_suvaṇṇarājahaṃsa_). ",
  "ja77:2.3": "The verse has seven lines, with each pair of lines having a different metre: _opacchandasaka_, _vetālīya_, and _tuṭṭhubha_ for the last three. ",
  "ja77:2.4": "This sentence is a prose addendum. The commentary takes it to be spoken by the Buddha, but because of _m’atthi_ (“there is for me”) it must be by the dreamer of the dreams. It seems to be an affirmation for someone suffering bad dreams: they remind themselves that the impossible, upside-down things they saw in the dream are not real. "
