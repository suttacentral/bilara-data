  "ja77:1.1": "King Pasenadi is perturbed by sixteen dreams, but the Buddha assures him that these do not affect him, but are portents of times to come. Each dream depicts an inversion or perversion of the just order of things. | Four black bulls depart without fighting. | Sapling trees flower. | Cows suckle at newborn valves. | Oxen are unyoked and calves given the reins. ",
  "ja77:1.2": "A horse eats from two mouths. | People beg a jackal to defecate in a fine goblet. | A she-jackal eats a rope as it is being spun. | People pour water into a full pitcher. ",
  "ja77:1.3": "A lotus-pond is muddy in the middle and clear on the edges. | Rice will not cook. | People barter sour milk for sandalwood. ",
  "ja77:2.2": "Text reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i> (“phoenix”), but commentary reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>suvaṇṇa</i> (“golden”), explaining as “golden royal geese” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>suvaṇṇarājahaṃsa</i>). ",
  "ja77:2.3": "The verse has seven lines, with each pair of lines having a different metre: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>opacchandasaka</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vetālīya</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tuṭṭhubha</i> for the last three. ",
  "ja77:2.4": "This sentence is a prose addendum, the force of which is not quite captured by the commentary, which takes it to be spoken by the Buddha, but because of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>matthi</i> (“there is for me”) it must be by the dreamer of the dreams. It seems to be an affirmation for someone suffering bad dreams: they remind themselves that the impossible things they saw in the dream are not real. "
