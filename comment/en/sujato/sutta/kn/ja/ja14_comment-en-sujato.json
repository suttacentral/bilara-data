  "ja14:1.1": "Even the elusive Wind-deer was trapped by honey left by the groundskeeper Victor. Having proven his point, the keeper released the deer. ",
  "ja14:1.2": "The commentary reads the ending (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ehi</i>) as locative (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>-esu</i>). | Here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>santhava</i> appears equivalent to Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁstāva</i>, a place for gathering, especially for recitation. The commentary explains, rather, as “those who are residents and those who are acquaintances”. ",
  "ja14:1.3": "According to Haṁsadeva’s 13th century Mṛgapakṣiśāstra, the “wind-deer” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vātamiga</i>, Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vātamṛga</i>) is fast, skilled at escaping weapons and vanishing from sight; dwelling in deep forests, it is lean with long legs and branched antlers. At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn9.8/en/sujato#4.2'>SN 9.8:4.2</a> it is said to be flighty and easily startled. | “Domesticated” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gehanissitaṁ</i>, which is to be accepted over the metrically-incorrect variant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gahananissitaṁ</i>. The confusion is evidently an old one, since the commentary glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>geha</i> (“home”) with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gahanaṭṭhāna</i> (“place in the jungle”). But <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gehanissita</i> regularly refers to thoughts or desires connected with the comforts and pleasures of domestic life. "
