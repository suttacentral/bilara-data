  "ja14:1.1": "Even the elusive Wind-deer was trapped by honey left by the groundskeeper Victor. Having proven his point, the keeper released the deer. ",
  "ja14:1.2": "The commentary reads the ending (_-ehi_) as locative (_-esu_). | Here _santhava_ appears equivalent to Sanskrit _saṁstāva_, a place for gathering, especially for recitation. The commentary explains, rather, as “those who are residents and those who are acquaintances”. ",
  "ja14:1.3": "According to Haṁsadeva’s 13th century Mṛgapakṣiśāstra, the “wind-deer” (_vātamiga_, Sanskrit _vātamṛga_) is fast, skilled at escaping weapons and vanishing from sight; dwelling in deep forests, it is lean with long legs and branched antlers. At [sn9.8:4.2]() it is said to be flighty and easily startled. | “Domesticated” is _gehanissitaṁ_, which is to be accepted over the metrically-incorrect variant _gahananissitaṁ_. The confusion is evidently an old one, since the commentary glosses _geha_ (“home”) with _gahanaṭṭhāna_ (“place in the jungle”). But _gehanissita_ regularly refers to thoughts or desires connected with the comforts and pleasures of domestic life. "
