  "ja56:1.1": "A man discovers a large lump of gold, but must break it into four to make it useful. | The verse is almost identical with the previous, only differing in the key term. ",
  "ja56:1.2": "As with the previous verse, the key term _pahaṭṭha_ rests on both the story and a dual meaning. _Pahaṭṭha_ normally has the sense “cheerful” (_√haṁs_), but the commentary connects it rather with gold that has been forged (_√ghaṁs_) until it is luminous and radiant. "
