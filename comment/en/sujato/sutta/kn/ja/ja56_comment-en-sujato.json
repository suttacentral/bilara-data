  "ja56:1.1": "A man discovers a large lump of gold, but must break it into four to make it useful. | The verse is almost identical with the previous, only differing in the key term. ",
  "ja56:1.2": "As with the previous verse, the key term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pahaṭṭha</i> rests on both the story and a dual meaning. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pahaṭṭha</i> normally has the sense “cheerful” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>√haṁs</i>), but the commentary connects it rather with gold that has been forged (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>√ghaṁs</i>) until it is luminous and radiant.
