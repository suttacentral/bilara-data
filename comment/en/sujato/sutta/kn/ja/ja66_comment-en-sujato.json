  "ja66:1.1": "An ascetic desires the queen, but when he gains her he finds that his list of desires does not shrink but grows. ",
  "ja66:1.3": "_Aḷārakkhī_ is unique. More commonly we find _aḷārapamha_, where, as here _aḷāra_ is glossed as _visāla_, “wide”. Compare Sanskrit _arāḍa_, glossed with _ucchritaśṛṅga_, “high-horned”. It probably describes wide-open, expressive eyes (_akkhī_) with high, curved eyebrows (_pamha_). "
