  "ja3:1.1": "This verse is mostly the same as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.29/en/sujato#15.1'>AN 8.29:15.1</a>, which I believe is referring to the same story. The commentary tells of a fraudulent merchant who tried to trick a poor woman into thinking her gold vase was worthless. ",
  "ja3:1.4": "The commentary says his name was <i lang='pi' translate='no'>serivā</i>, but this seems implausible, as it is supposed to be after the city of Seri, but that does not appear anywhere else, nor does it play a role in the story. Rather, read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>seri</i> as “wanton”, for which see <i lang='pi' translate='no'>svairī</i> in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.11.5. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Serivā</i> is the possessive form, “wanton one”.
