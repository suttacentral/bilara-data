  "ja3:1.1": "This verse is mostly the same as [an8.29:15.1](), which I believe is referring to the same story. The commentary tells of a fraudulent merchant who tried to trick a poor woman into thinking her gold vase was worthless. ",
  "ja3:1.4": "The commentary says his name was _serivā_, but this seems implausible, as it is supposed to be after the city of Seri, but that does not appear anywhere else, nor does it play a role in the story. Rather, read _seri_ as “wanton”, for which see _svairī_ in Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.11.5. _Serivā_ is the possessive form, “wanton one”. "
