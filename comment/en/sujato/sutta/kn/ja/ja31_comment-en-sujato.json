  "ja31:1.1": "Apart from a couple of variant readings, this verse is identical with that from <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.6/en/sujato'>SN 11.6</a>. | In Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, Mātali is the charioteer of Indra/Sakka. Here Sakka is telling him not to harm the nests, acknowledging the unacceptable ecological damage of warfare. | The commentary interprets <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kulāvakā</i> as “nestlings”, but it refers rather to the “nests”.
