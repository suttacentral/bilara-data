  "ja31:1.1": "Apart from a couple of variant readings, this verse is identical with that from [sn11.6](). | In Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, Mātali is the charioteer of Indra/Sakka. Here Sakka is telling him not to harm the nests, acknowledging the unacceptable ecological damage of warfare. | The commentary interprets _kulāvakā_ as “nestlings”, but it refers rather to the “nests”.
