  "ja50:1.1": "The Bodhisatta, though an unbeliever, regularly offers flowers to a deity while still the crown prince. On ascending the throne, he announces that he must pay back the deity by offering a thousand evildoers in sacrifice. The bluff had the intended effect, for from that day not a single evildoer was to be found. ",
  "ja50:1.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Upayācita</i> here has the same meaning as in Sanskrit, a promise or pledge made to propitiate a deity. It occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja544/en/sujato#122.1'>Ja 544:122.1</a> in the same sense. "
