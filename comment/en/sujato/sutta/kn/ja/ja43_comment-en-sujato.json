  "ja43:1.1": "The commentary relates the story of an ascetic who kept a viper as a pet, despite being warned it will turn on him one day. Similar to Aesop’s fable *The Farmer and the Viper*, this story is retold in modern songs and politics. The viper was named Veḷuka because it lived in a tube of bamboo (_veḷu_), and the ascetic cared for it like a father. Note, however, that the verse says nothing about a viper. ",
  "ja43:1.4": "Compare [sn42.19](), where a low-caste acrobat who engages in a dangerous balancing act with their student is protected by the fact that they listen to each others’ wise advice. There, the “pole acrobat” is _vaṁsika_, whereas here it is the synonymous _veḷuka_. "
