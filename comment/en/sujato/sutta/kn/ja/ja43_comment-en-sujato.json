  "ja43:1.1": "The commentary relates the story of an ascetic who kept a viper as a pet, despite being warned it will turn on him one day. Similar to Aesop’s fable <em>The Farmer and the Viper</em>, this story is retold in modern songs and politics. The viper was named Veḷuka because it lived in a tube of bamboo (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>veḷu</i>), and the ascetic cared for it like a father. Note, however, that the verse says nothing about a viper. ",
  "ja43:1.4": "Compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn42.19/en/sujato'>SN 42.19</a>, where a low-caste acrobat who engages in a dangerous balancing act with their student is protected by the fact that they listen to each others’ wise advice. There, the “pole acrobat” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṁsika</i>, whereas here it is the synonymous <i lang='pi' translate='no'>veḷuka</i>. "
