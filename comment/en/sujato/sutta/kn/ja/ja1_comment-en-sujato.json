  "ja1:2.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Apaṇṇaka</i> (“unfailing”) is a gambling term, where <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṇṇa</i> appears as a form of the number five. While a hand of four dice was “perfect” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaṭa</i>), the fifth “losing” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kali</i>) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Apaṇṇaka</i> is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”. See further note on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn60/en/sujato#12.5'>MN 60:12.5</a>. ",
  "ja1:2.2": "In the prose story, the “sophists” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>takkikā</i>) are compared to a native spirit (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkha</i>) who tried to persuade a caravan to abandon its water in the desert. ",
  "ja1:2.4": "This line draws on the gambling imagery: one would “take up” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gaṇhe</i>) that which is “unfailing”, namely a “winning hand” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaṭaggāha</i>). In the ancient Vedic game of chance, a large quantity of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vibhītaka</i> (“bedda”) nuts were placed in a hollow, from which players would take a handful. If the number of nuts was divisible by four, it was said to be a “perfect” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaṭa</i>) “hand” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gāha</i>). "
