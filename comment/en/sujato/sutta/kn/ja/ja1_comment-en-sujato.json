  "ja1:2.1": "_Apaṇṇaka_ (“unfailing”) is a gambling term, where _paṇṇa_ appears as a form of the number five. While a hand of four dice was “perfect” (_kaṭa_), the fifth “losing” (_kali_) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). _Apaṇṇaka_ is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”. See further note on [mn60:12.5](). ",
  "ja1:2.2": "In the prose story, the “sophists” (_takkikā_) are compared to a native spirit (_yakkha_) who tried to persuade a caravan to abandon its water in the desert. ",
  "ja1:2.4": "This line draws on the gambling imagery: one would “take up” (_gaṇhe_) that which is “unfailing”, namely a “winning hand” (_kaṭaggāha_). In the ancient Vedic game of chance, a large quantity of _vibhītaka_ (“bedda”) nuts were placed in a hollow, from which players would take a handful. If the number of nuts was divisible by four, it was said to be a “perfect” (_kaṭa_) “hand” (_gāha_). "
