  "ja59:1.1": "A drummer with his boy earned money playing drums at a festival. On the return journey, however, the boy’s incessant beating attracted  the attention of bandits. | The story and title speak of a “drum” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bheri</i>), while the verse uses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhamati</i>, which normally means “blows”. The repeated idiom recalls the onomatopoetic Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhamadhamā</i>, which in Marathi, Hindi, Kannada, and Nepali has the sense of a repeated drumbeat. On the other hand, the next verse is almost identical and concerns the blower of a conch or horn. Rather than rendering the two verses to match the commentary, I assume they originally had the same sense. ",
  "ja59:1.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sataṁ</i> is explained as “a hundred dollars”. But there is a play on words here, for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sataṁ</i> can also mean “the good, the true”. ",
