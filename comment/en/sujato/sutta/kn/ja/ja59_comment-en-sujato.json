  "ja59:1.1": "A drummer with his boy earned money playing drums at a festival. On the return journey, however, the boy’s incessant beating attracted  the attention of bandits. | The story and title speak of a “drum” (_bheri_), but the verse uses _dhamati_, “blows”. Perhaps we can extend the sense of _dhamati_ to “sounds”, but in the absence of such a sense in Sanskrit dictionaries, I suspect a verse about blowing a horn was grafted on to a story about beating a drum. ",
  "ja59:1.3": "_Sataṁ_ is explained as “a hundred dollars”. But there is a play on words here, for _sataṁ_ can also mean “the good, the true”. "
