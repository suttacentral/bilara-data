  "ja75:1.1": "Due to drought, a pond dried out and the crows feasted on the fish. One of the fish prayed for salvation to the god of rain, Pajjuna, who appears also in [dn20:17.7](). The previous verse featured Vāta, the wind, following which comes Pajjuna, the thunderstorm. Thus the two go together, as so often in the Vedas. | The story and this verse appears in [cp30](), where it illustrates the perfection of truth. ",
  "ja75:1.2": "The commentary says the sense is that the stranded fish are the “trove” of the feasting crow, and it must be “destroyed” for the crow by being covered with water. It seems like a forced interpretation, and I suspect the original context has been lost. In Vedic tradition, the crow can stand for sins or ills that are expelled with sacred bathing (Skanda Purāṇa 3.3.1.56–58). ",
  "ja75:1.3": "Pajjuna is fructifying and blessed, but also fearful and destructive (Rig Veda 5.83). ",
  "ja75:1.4": "[cp30:7.6]() has _macche_ (“the fish”) instead of _mañca_ (“me”). "
