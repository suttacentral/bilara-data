  "ja75:1.1": "Due to drought, a pond dried out and the crows feasted on the fish. One of the fish prayed for salvation to the god of rain, Pajjuna, who appears also in [dn20:17.7](). The previous verse featured Vāta, the wind, following which comes Pajjuna, the thunderstorm. Thus the two go together, as they do often in the Vedas. | The story and this verse appears in [cp30](), where it illustrates the perfection of truth. ",
  "ja75:1.2": "The commentary says the sense is that the stranded fish are the “trove” (_nidhi_) of the feasting crow, which is “wiped out” by being covered with water. ",
  "ja75:1.3": "Pajjuna is fructifying and blessed, but also fearful and destructive (Rig Veda 5.83). ",
  "ja75:1.4": "[cp30:7.6]() has _macche_ (“the fish”) instead of _mañca_ (“me”). If _mañca_ is accepted, there is no mention of fish in the verse. The original verse may have focused more specifically on the “trove of the crow”, i.e. the deathly drought, from which the waters offer relief. | In Vedic tradition, the waters are invoked to save one from the sin wiped by the crow’s mouth, the kiss of the dread goddess of black death, Nirṛti (Atharva Veda 7.64). The wish to harm the crow is distinctly un-Buddhist and more characteristic of the Atharva. Otherwise, though, the two passages are not similar, except they both end with the same verb. "
