  "thag1.1:4.2": "The word _deva_ (“god”) is closely connected with the idea of the sky. The “god” of thunder and rain (perhaps to be identified with the god named Pajjuna) is a terrifying threat to those who are exposed outdoors. Here the monk snug in his little hut invokes the god in contrast to the safety of peace. This idea recurs many times in the Theragāthā. At [snp1.2]() the same notion occurs in the context of making household offerings to the gods. "
