  "thag11.1:4.3": "The parallel to this verse at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja10/en/sujato'>Ja 10</a> is identical except it is addressed to a king. The form there is unambiguously vocative (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rāja</i>), so I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu</i> here as also vocative, although the commentary reads it as nominative.
