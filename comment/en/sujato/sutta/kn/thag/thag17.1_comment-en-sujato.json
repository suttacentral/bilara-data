  "thag17.1:1.3": "No <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṇḍara</i> clan is known elsewhere. Given that the text goes on to discuss robe colors of mendicants, the name, which means “white”, probably refers to ascetics wearing white robes, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāṇḍarabhikṣu</i> of Yaśomitra’s Sphuṭārthā Abhidharmakośavyākhyā 300 and Mahāvyutpatti 179. Soma is exalted as “white-robed” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāṇḍaravāsa</i>) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.3. ",
  "thag17.1:7.4": "This is probably an indirect reference to the Second Council, where one of the difficulties was ensuring the proceedings were carried out by monks on integrity. ",
  "thag17.1:9.2": "Another reference to the Second Council, whose primary issue was the use of money by monastics. ",
  "thag17.1:11.2": "The Śāriputraparipṛcchā (T24, no. 1465, 900.c18) says that the Mahīśāsaka school wore blue robes. They were probably based in Mahissatī, which is close by the kingdom of the Pāṇḍyas. Perhaps this sutta records tensions in the early community of the southern region, leading to the formation of distinct groups of monastics differentiated by their robe colors. ",
  "thag17.1:13.4": "Text here uses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>odāta</i> rather than <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṇḍara</i> for “white”. ",
  "thag17.1:17.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Milakkhu</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mleccha</i>) has the sense “copper-colored”, “vermillion” as well as the more common “foreigner”. ",
  "thag17.1:20.1": "The “six-tusked” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>chaddanta</i>) elephant was a mystical beast. The story of how he was struck by an arrow and uttered these verses is told in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja514/en/sujato'>Ja 514</a>. ",
  "thag17.1:21.1": "This verse and the next are found at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp9/en/sujato'>Dhp 9</a> f. and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja514/en/sujato#26.1'>Ja 514:26.1</a> f. The text and commentary here do not specify which verses were spoken by the elephant, so I assume they are the same two mentioned in the Jātaka. "
