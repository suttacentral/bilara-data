  "iti48:4.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kāsāvakaṇṭhā</i> is usually taken as “ochre-necks” with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaṇṭha</i> in the sense “throat”, but the commentary is not so clear: “It seems that, having tied a single ochre scrap (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>khaṇḍa</i>) around their hand or neck (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gīvā</i>) they wander about.” Thus while the commentary mentions the neck, it directly glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kaṇṭha</i> with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khaṇḍa</i>, a term for a scrap or portion; eg. a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>cammakhaṇḍa</i> is an item made from scraps of leather (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15/en/sujato#2.1.8'>Bu Pc 15:2.1.8</a>). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Khaṇḍa</i> is doubly appropriate, since it is a common word for “broken” precepts.
