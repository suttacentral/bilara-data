  "iti48:4.1": "_Kāsāvakaṇṭhā_ is usually taken as “ochre-necks” with _kaṇṭha_ in the sense “throat”, but the commentary is not so clear: “It seems that, having tied a single ochre scrap (_khaṇḍa_) around their hand or neck (_gīvā_) they wander about.” Thus while the commentary mentions the neck, it directly glosses _kaṇṭha_ with _khaṇḍa_, a term for a scrap or portion; eg. a _cammakhaṇḍa_ is an item made from scraps of leather ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:2.1.8]()). _Khaṇḍa_ is doubly appropriate, since it is a common word for “broken” precepts.
