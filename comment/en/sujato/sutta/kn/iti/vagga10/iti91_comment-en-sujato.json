  "iti91:2.4": "The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. Generally, ordination should not be given in such cases, but if it is given, those performing it incur an offense of wrong-doing. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king ([pli-tv-kd1:40.1.1]()). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the thrust of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained ([pli-tv-kd1:41.1.1]()). | Another man ordained to escape debt ([pli-tv-kd1:46.1.1]()). | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood ([pli-tv-kd1:49.1.1]()). | The only item that does not straightforwardly correspond is “in fear” (_bhayaṭṭa_). In the Vinaya sequence, the ordination of slaves appears at this point ([pli-tv-kd1:47.1.1]()). The connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier Puṇṇikā, who speaks of living “in fear” of her masters’ abuse and beatings. "
