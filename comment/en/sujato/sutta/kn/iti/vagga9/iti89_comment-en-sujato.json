It became a standard hell in later texts of the Buddhists (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/kv23.3/en/sujato#1.10'>Kv 23.3:1.10</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/vb3/en/sujato#23.4'>Vb 3:23.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/cnd23/en/sujato#44.3'>Cnd 23:44.3</a>) and Brahmans (eg. Bhāgavata Purāṇa 5.26.28).
