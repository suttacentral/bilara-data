But <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māṇava</i> is not used elsewhere in this sense (PTS Dict’s ref to Thig 7.1 notwithstanding), nor does such a sense seem to be attested in the Sanskrit dictionaries. The context is the Buddha’s unattachment to “clan” and it surely has the sense here of “youngling”, either children or students. ",
