  "snp3.4:4.1": "Here _rājaputta_ is a synonym of _khattiya_. ",
  "snp3.4:5.3": "Norman and Bodhi follow the commentary’s _manussehi_ (“humans”). But _māṇava_ is not used elsewhere in this sense (PTS Dict’s ref to Thig 7.1 notwithstanding), nor does such a sense seem to be attested in the Sanskrit dictionaries. The context is the Buddha’s unattachment to “clan” and it surely has the sense here of “youngling”, either children or students. ",
  "snp3.4:7.3": "The Buddha is demonstrating his expertise. The verse here called Sāvittī (Samskrit Sāvitrī) may be recited in Gāyatrī or Anuṣṭubh metres. The form specified here is the Gāyatrī, which is the form recommended for the initiation of a student in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14), and probably represents the lineage in which Siddhattha practiced under his former teachers. ",
  "snp3.4:11.2": "Norman and Bodhi both have “approach and ask”, but _upasaṅkamma_ is absolutive: he is already there. ",
  "snp3.4:14.2": "The line plays with _jāti_ (“birth”), _jāyati_ (“give birth”), and _jātavedas_. The latter term is a Vedic word for fire or “flame”. Its meaning is obscure, but I think the sense is _jāta_ (“those who have been born”, i.e. “mortals”) plus _vedas_ (“knowledge”), i.e. “one who brings knowledge to mortals”. This is the fire-god Agni, who comes down from the sun to the sacrificial fire, bringing light and awareness and Vedic knowledge to those who have been born, namely mortal humans. In this passage, it implies that anyone who “has been born” can “give birth” to “knowledge” regardless of their “birth”. ",
  "snp3.4:30.5": "Here the Buddha refers to himself as a _yakkha_. "
