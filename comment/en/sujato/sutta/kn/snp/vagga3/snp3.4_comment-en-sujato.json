  "snp3.4:5.3": "Norman and Bodhi follow the commentary’s <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manussehi</i> (“humans”). But <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māṇava</i> is not used elsewhere in this sense (PTS Dict’s ref to Thig 7.1 notwithstanding), nor does such a sense seem to be attested in the Sanskrit dictionaries. The context is the Buddha’s unattachment to “clan” and it surely has the sense here of “youngling”, either children or students. ",
  "snp3.4:7.3": "The verse here called Sāvittī (Samskrit Sāvitrī) may be recited in Gāyatrī or  Anuṣṭubh metres. The form specified here is the Gāyatrī, which is the form recommended for the initiation of a student in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13, and probably represents the lineage in which Siddhattha practiced under his former teachers. ",
  "snp3.4:11.2": "Norman and Bodhi both have “approach and ask”, but <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upasaṅkamma</i> is absolutive: he is already there. ",
  "snp3.4:14.2": "The line puns <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāti</i> (“birth”) with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāyati</i> (“give birth”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jātaveda</i> (“born knowledge”?), a poetic word for fire. "
