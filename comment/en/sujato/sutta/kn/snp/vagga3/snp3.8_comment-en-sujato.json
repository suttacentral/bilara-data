  "snp3.8:1.1": "A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nimitta</i> is a sign or portent, and is commonly used in the context of omens, prophecy, or fortune-telling. Here it means that there is no portent or omen by which one can predict the extent of life. ",

  "snp3.8:17.4": "The commentary says this means, “I cannot bring back the dead”, which is followed by Norman and Bodhi. But I think the text elides a second negative and should read: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na eso alabbhā</i>, literally “This is not not-to-be-gotten by me”, i.e. “I cannot escape this”. "
