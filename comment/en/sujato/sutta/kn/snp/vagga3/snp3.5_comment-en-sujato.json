  "snp3.5:5.5": "Bodhi translates <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ārādhaye</i> as simple present tense here (“succeeds”) and in the identical line below as imperative (“should accomplish”). Norman has the optative mood in both cases, which is surely correct. ",
  "snp3.5:24.1": "The “speaker’s mark” is in MS treated as part of the line, which is unusual if not unique. According to Norman’s note here however, we should consider this line a seven-syllable sloka (perhaps restoring the variant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ca</i> to make it eight). I have adjusted the Pali punctuation accordingly. ",
  "snp3.5:26.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bajjhati</i> (“bound”) seems odd to me in this line. I think it’s more likely these are three semi-synonyms. As it stands, the Buddha does not actually answer the question, since he only discusses the positive side. PTS notes a reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bujjhati</i> in the commentary, which I follow. However the commentary reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bajjhati</i> in the VRI edition, and the comment itself supports this, since it treats it as a bad thing. If it is a mistake, then, it is an old one. ",
