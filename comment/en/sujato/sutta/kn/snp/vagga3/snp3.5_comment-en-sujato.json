  "snp3.5:1.3": "Māgha (“the descendant of Magha”) is here associated with the quality of generosity, from the Vedic word _magha_ as “gift, bounty”. Maghavā is a name of Sakka, since he was at one time a brahmin student named Magha ([sn11.12:1.3](), [sn11.13:6.1]()); this passage immediately precedes one that extols his generosity. A god name Māgha appears in [sn2.3](), although not associated with generosity. Finally, the good king of [mn83]() is named Maghadeva, “god of bounty”. ",
  "snp3.5:5.5": "Bodhi translates _ārādhaye_ as simple present tense here (“succeeds”) and in the identical line below as imperative (“should accomplish”). Norman has the optative mood in both cases, which is surely correct. ",
  "snp3.5:24.1": "The “speaker’s mark” is in MS treated as part of the line, which is unusual if not unique. According to Norman’s note here however, we should consider this line a seven-syllable sloka (perhaps restoring the variant _ca_ to make it eight). I have adjusted the Pali punctuation accordingly. ",
  "snp3.5:26.1": "_Bajjhati_ (“bound”) seems odd to me in this line. I think it’s more likely these are three semi-synonyms. As it stands, the Buddha does not actually answer the question, since he only discusses the positive side. PTS notes a reading _bujjhati_ in the commentary, which I follow. However the commentary reads _bajjhati_ in the VRI edition, and the comment itself supports this, since it treats it as a bad thing. If it is a mistake, then, it is an old one. ",
