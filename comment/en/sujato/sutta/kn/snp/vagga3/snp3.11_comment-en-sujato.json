  "snp3.11:1.2": "Bodhi and Norman follow the PTS reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sakkacca</i> here, but it seems uncharacteristic to me. Why mention they have just honored Indra? On the other hand, it’s common to express “a group with its leader”. ",
  "snp3.11:6.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Narāsabha</i> is literally “a bull of a man”, but the predominant sense is “chief”, “lord” rather than “bull”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vṛṣabha</i> was widely used in this sense as far back as the Rig Veda, unlike English, where “bull” conveys quite a different set of connotations. The same is true of its synonyms <i lang='pi' translate='no'>janavasabha</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>purisnisabha</i>, but not <i lang='pi' translate='no'>purisūsabho</i> at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#10.21.4'>Bu Pj 1:10.21.4</a>.

There is an almost complete lack of royal language in this text, the sole exception being the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>antepura</i> “royal compound” in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#17.2'>Snp 3.11:17.2</a>.

  "snp3.11:9.3": "Here, as so often, “autumn” (per Bodhi and Norman) conveys quite the wrong impression. Autumn is the time of gathering clouds, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sarada</i> is the time after the rains. ",
  "snp3.11:11.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Jaṭī</i> is an abbreviated form of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jaṭila</i>, a matted hair ascetic, usually Brahmanical. ",
  "snp3.11:11.2": "Here the commentary glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṇḍu</i> as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ratta</i> (“red”), followed by both Norman (“pale red”) and Bodhi.

  "snp3.11:16.3": "Neither Bodhi’s “fortitude” nor Norman’s “peerless one” quite capture the force of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>asamadhura</i>. The implication is that, as the forger of the path, the Buddha carries a burden greater than any other. ",
  "snp3.11:18.1": "Note the idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>parato ghosaṁ</i> here. ",
  "snp3.11:18.2": "This is a succinct definition of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>buddha</i>, not an alternate thing that you might hear people say, per Bodhi and Norman. ",
  "snp3.11:18.3": "Both Norman and Bodhi have “doctrine” here, while commentary is silent. I’m not aware of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samaya</i> in the sense of “doctrine” in the early texts, nor is it listed in the senses of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samaya</i> in the commentarial analysis in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī commentary, Kāmāvacarakusala. Given that the concern in previous lines is the notion of an awakened one, surely we have here an abbreviated <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhisamaya</i> i.e. “breakthrough, enlightenment experience”.

Yes, the text speaks of practice, but this correlates to the first part of the answer. Here, at the end of the question, it relates to the end of the text, which speaks of the state of sagacity. ",
  "snp3.11:25.1": "Note that, despite the etymology, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uccāvaca</i> seems to be used more in the sense of “diversity” rather than “high and low”; eg. the colors of a rainbow.

  "snp3.11:28.2": "As other instances of this line make clear, the referent of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yattha</i> is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāmā</i>, i.e. the pleasures of the senses, not the desire and greed (of the previous line). Bodhi gets this nuance right, Norman does not. ",
  "snp3.11:28.4": "For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>naraka</i> here, Bodhi has “inferno”, Norman “hell”; but the metaphor of “crossing over” better fits the normal sense of “cliff” or “abyss” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#5.9'>MN 49:5.9</a>, mn86:6.15](), <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag16.8/en/sujato#4.2'>Thag 16.8:4.2</a>). Notably, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>naraka</i> is not strongly attested in the sense of “hell” for pre-Buddhist Sanskrit either, although we do find <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāraka</i>, apparently in the sense of “hell being”, at Atharva Veda 12.4.36c and Śukla Yajur Veda 30.5.

  "snp3.11:33.2": "Bodhi’s “should not behave rashly” and Norman’s “should not pursue his search for food inconsiderately” confuse a plain meaning. When on alms round a mendicant should not walk too fast, else the families have no time to ready the food. ",
  "snp3.11:36.1": "As above, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uccāvaca</i> probably means “diverse” practices rather than “high and low” per commentary followed by Bodhi and Norman. The only usage of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uccāvaca</i> in the context of practice is the “diverse duties” performed by mendicants for their fellows (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#3.3.17'>DN 33:3.3.17</a>).

This is overlooked by both Bodhi and Norman, although it evidently underlies the commentary. ",
  "snp3.11:36.4": "Both Bodhi and Norman discuss this line, without any compelling conclusion. The problematic <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mutaṁ</i> cannot mean “experienced” per Bodhi and Norman following the commentary. Since the Kathāvatthu is by far the earliest source on this verse, I suggest we adopt its reading that the verse is about “falling away”, and amend <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mutaṁ</i> to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>cutaṁ</i>.

  "snp3.11:38.1": "The PTS edition, as does the BJT, has a reciter’s remark here identifying the speaker as the Buddha, and this is translated without comment by Norman and Bodhi.

  "snp3.11:41.1": "By forcing the commentary’s sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kitti</i> into <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nigghosa</i>, Bodhi and Norman confuse a simple meaning. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nighosa</i> (more commonly spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nigghosa</i>) just means “word, teaching, statement”, eg. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tava sutvāna nigghosaṁ</i> “having heard your teaching”.
