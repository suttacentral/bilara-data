  "snp3.10:16.1": "I can’t find any evidence to support the commentary’s gloss as “liar”. I assume it is shorthand for _vebhūtiya_ which is a synonym of _pesuṇiya_ ([dn30:2.21.2]() and [dn28:11.2]()).",
  "snp3.10:16.4": "I can’t find any explanation for the shift to direct address in second person here. Perhaps these verses were inserted from a separate source.",
  "snp3.10:17.1": "Norman and Bodhi both accept commentary’s _kilesarajaṃ attani pakkhipasi_, but this seems too narrow; their deeds harmed others too.",
  "snp3.10:20.1": "Commentary says the hell-keepers are the subject here, hell-dwellers the subject of the next line. But this seems forced and unnecessary. Those going to hell are screaming, not uttering sweet words.",
  "snp3.10:20.4": "Read _aggini-samaṁ jalitaṁ_, as at [snp3.10:22.2]() below. ",
  "snp3.10:29.1": "The commentary says that these two verses are absent from the old “Great Commentary”. Bodhi takes this as a sign they were a later addition. Norman thinks otherwise, arguing that these verses answer the question asked in the prose introduction. But that question has already been answered in the prose, so I don’t think this is a compelling reason. Norman also argues on the basis of metre, which I’m not competent to assess. On the whole, however, I tend to agree with Bodhi here."
