  "snp3.10:29.1": "The commentary says that these two verses are absent from the old “Great Commentary”. Bodhi takes this as a sign they were a later addition. Norman thinks otherwise, arguing that these verses answer the question asked in the prose introduction. But that question has already been answered in the prose, so I don’t think this is a compelling reason. Norman also argues on the basis of metre, which I’m not competent to assess. On the whole, however, I tend to agree with Bodhi here. "
