  "snp3.9:3.2": "_Vattasampanno_ (Sanskrit _vṛttasaṁpanna_) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone who is “of good conduct, knows the law, and speaks the truth” (_vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini_. See also eg. Mahābhārata 3.188.90b, 13.61.029a, Rāmāyaṇa 1.47.25c). ",
  "snp3.9:11.1": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).  See [dn16:5.6.3](). ",
  "snp3.9:18.2": "I think _yāna_ should be taken literally here as a chariot; consider the classic Indic imagery of flying chariots of the gods. "
