  "snp4.7:6.3": "_Gedha_ also at an5.103:3.2, where the apparent sense is not “entanglement” but “cover from sight”. See Norman’s note on this verse for the apparent confusion between _gedha_, _rodha_, and the intermediary _godha_.",
  "snp4.7:7.1": "A line used of Devadatta at iti89:4.1.",
  "snp4.7:7.4": "Bodhi follows the commentary in rendering _parikissati_ as “afflicted”, as does Norman with “troubled”, both essentially reading as a contracted _parikilissati_. But _parikissati_ here is connected primarily with wisdom (or lack thereof), not suffering. Surely the context is provided by such passages as an4.106, where _parikassati_ is the mind that “drags” a person around. _Parikissati_ is the passive form."
