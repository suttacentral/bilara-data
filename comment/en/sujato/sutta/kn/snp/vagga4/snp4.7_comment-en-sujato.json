  "snp4.7:7.1": "A line used of Devadatta at [iti89:4.1]().",
  "snp4.7:7.4": "Bodhi follows the commentary and Niddesa in rendering _parikissati_ as “afflicted”, as does Norman with “troubled”, both assuming a contracted _parikilissati_. But _parikissati_ here is connected with wisdom (or lack thereof), not suffering. Surely we should look to such passages as [an4.186:2.6](), where _parikassati_ is the mind that “drags” a person around. _Parikissati_ is the passive form.",
  "snp4.7:8.2": "At [pli-tv-pvr15:7.2]() _pubbāpara_ is defined in terms of changing and inconsistent behavior."
