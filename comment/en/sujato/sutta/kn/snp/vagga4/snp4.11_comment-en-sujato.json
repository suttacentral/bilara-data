  "snp4.11:2.1": "_Piya_, “things held dear” or “what is liked”. ",
  "snp4.11:3.4": "_Samparāya_ means “in the next life”. The Niddesa’s gloss of “refuge, shelter” etc. does not change this but qualifies it: people look for safety in the next life. ",
  "snp4.11:7.2": "Here _dvaya_ refers back to the “pair” of the previous lines and should not be overinterpreted as “duality”. ",
  "snp4.11:12.1": "The past participle _sameta_ here is glossed by Niddesa as _paṭipanna_, i.e. “engaged in the practice”. ",
  "snp4.11:13.1": "_Visaññī_ is used of one whose perception is distorted by grief ([thig6.2:1.2]()), by alcohol ([Bu Pc 51:1.40](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/brahmali#1.40)), or by the four “distortions of perception” ([an4.49:3.5]()). _Saññasaññī _ is the opposite. ",
  "snp4.11:13.2": "This verse answers the question of how one is to practice so that form disappears. It describes the process that leads from the fourth jhana to the formless states. ",
  "snp4.11:13.4": "In [mn18](), we have the sequence perception, thought, proliferation, then _papañcasaññāsaṅkhā_. This suggests that _papañca_ causes _saṅkhā_, as per Bodhi. ",
  "snp4.11:14.1": "Oddly, however, the disappearance of _sukha_ and _dukkha_ is not directly answered. It is, however, implied in the surmounting of 3rd _jhāna_. ",
  "snp4.11:15.1": "At [an10.29:20.2](), the best of those who advocate the “ultimate purity of the spirit” are said to be those who teach the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, by which the Buddha is referring to the Brahmanical teacher Uddaka Rāmaputta ([mn26:16.13]()), said by the Buddha to be “astute” (_paṇḍita_ [mn26:23.5]()).

  "snp4.11:15.3": "Niddesa treats _samaya_ as “stilling” (_sama_), in the sense of the cessation of a sentient being. The normal meaning is “occasion”, which fits well here. Niddesa and commentary explain this second class of so-called experts as the annihilationists. "
