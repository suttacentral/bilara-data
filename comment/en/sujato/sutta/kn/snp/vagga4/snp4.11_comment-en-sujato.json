  "snp4.11:3.4": "_Samparāya_ means “in the next life”. The Niddesa’s gloss of “refuge, shelter” etc. does not change this but qualifies it: people look for safety in the next life. ",
  "snp4.11:7.2": "Here _dvaya_ refers back to the “pair” of the previous lines and should not be overinterpreted as “duality”. ",
  "snp4.11:12.1": "The past participle _sameta_ here is glossed by Niddesa as _paṭipanna_, i.e. “engaged in the practice”. ",

  "snp4.11:13.2": "This verse answers the question of how one is to practice so that form disappears. It describes the process that leads from the fourth jhana to the formless states.",

  "snp4.11:14.1": "Oddly, however, the disappearance of _sukha_ and _dukkha_ is not directly answered. It is, however, implied in the surmounting of 3rd _jhāna_. ",
  "snp4.11:15.1": "Such as the Buddha’s former teachers, who aimed at rebirth in formless realms. See [an10.29:20.1](). ",
  "snp4.11:15.3": "Niddesa treats _samaya_ as “stilling” (_sama_), in the sense of the cessation of a sentient being. The normal meaning is “occasion”, which fits well here. Niddesa and commentary explain this second class of so-called experts as the annihilationists."
