  "snp4.9:1.1": "Māra’s daughters, the archetypal temptresses. Their failed seduction is told at [sn4.25](). _Arati_ seems to be an error in the Pali tradition for _rati_. ",
  "snp4.9:1.3": "The commentary is surely correct in glossing these lines as _**kimevidaṁ** imissā dārikāya **muttakarīsapuṇṇaṁ** rūpaṁ_. _Idaṁ_ (neuter) refers to the body (_rūpa_) not to the girl. It’s a meaningful distinction; the Buddha was criticizing the nature of the  body, not shaming the person. ",
  "snp4.9:1.4": "_Icche_ is 1st optative. _Naṁ_ is rendered as feminine (“her”) by Norman and Bodhi, but it agrees with _idaṁ_ in the previous line, so it should be neuter (“it”). Again, the Buddha says nothing in criticism of the woman, only of the body. ",
  "snp4.9:3.1": "The sense only emerges with the specific nuance of terms. _Niccheyya_ means to “judge, decide” not simply “consider”; and _samuggahītaṁ_ means “[a view that is] adopted” (not “assumed” or “grasped”). Finally, the _na_ here applies, not just to _idaṁ vadāmi_, but also to _samuggahītaṁ_, with which _idaṁ_ agrees. ",
  "snp4.9:5.1": "I think the case should be read here as “instrumental of relation”, since the question was not, “how is peace attained”, but “how is it described”. ",
  "snp4.9:5.3": "_Pi_ here doesn’t qualify _sīlabbata_ (per Norman), it co-ordinates with _nopi tena_. I capture this with the not/nor construction. ",
  "snp4.9:12.3": "_Neyyo_ has the sense “needing to be led”, for example a student who “requires education” before they can master a passage ([an4.133:1.3]()). Here it refers to the arahant. ",
  "snp4.9:12.4": "_Anupanīto_ (“not led in”) relates to _neyyo_ in the previous line. _Anupanīto_ has the sense of “one who has been educated (in recitation)” at [mn93:15.2](). Compare English “brought into the fold”. The sense of “dogma” for _nivesana_ is established at [snp4.3:6.3]() and [snp4.5:6.3](). "
