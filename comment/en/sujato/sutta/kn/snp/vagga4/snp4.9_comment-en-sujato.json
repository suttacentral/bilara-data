  "snp4.9:1.1": "Māra’s daughters, the archetypal temptresses. Their failed seduction is told at [sn4.25](). | _Arati_ seems to be an error in the Pali tradition for _rati_. ",
  "snp4.9:1.3": "The commentary is surely correct in glossing these lines as _**kimevidaṁ** imissā dārikāya **muttakarīsapuṇṇaṁ** rūpaṁ_. _Idaṁ_ (neuter) refers to the body (_rūpa_) not to the girl. It’s a meaningful distinction; the Buddha was criticizing the nature of the  body, not shaming the person. ",
  "snp4.9:1.4": "_Icche_ is 1st optative. _Naṁ_ is rendered as feminine (“her”) by Norman and Bodhi, but it agrees with _idaṁ_ in the previous line, so it should be neuter (“it”). Again, the Buddha says nothing in criticism of the woman, only of the body. ",
  "snp4.9:3.1": "The sense only emerges with the specific nuance of terms. _Niccheyya_ means to “judge, decide” not simply “consider”; and _samuggahītaṁ_ means “[a view that is] adopted” (not “assumed” or “grasped”). Finally, the _na_ here applies, not just to _idaṁ vadāmi_, but also to _samuggahītaṁ_, with which _idaṁ_ agrees. ",
  "snp4.9:4.2": "Two Māgaṇḍiyas appear in the Pali canon: here and in [mn75]() where he attacks the Buddha as a destroyer of life. As to the protagonist of the current sutta, the Pali commentary, Divyāvadāna 36—which calls him Mākandika—and the Chinese parallel in the Arthapada (T iv 180) say he too hails from the Kuru country, as also at [mn75](). Now, the Mahābhārata and other Sanskrit sources name Mākandī as a city or province on the banks of the Ganges, in the Pañcāla kingdom south of Hastināpura. This more-or-less agrees with Māgaṇḍiya’s home in the Kuru country, and suggests his name means “the man from Mākandī”. Divyāvadāna 36 and Sanskrit fragment say the Mākandika of the current sutta was also a wanderer, which does not contradict the position of the Pali commentaries and the Arthapada that he was a brahmin. At [an5.294-302:1.1]() _māgaṇḍika_ is listed as a type of ascetic; these could well be students of Māgaṇḍiya. Kathāsaritsāgara 15 tells the comic farce of an ascetic from Mākandikā on the banks of the Ganges, who fell in love with the daughter of a merchant and went to ridiculous lengths to obtain her, only to end up a laughing-stock. This story could well have begun life as a comic inversion of this sutta. Reading all these sources together, we can posit that there was a brahmin wanderer from Mākandī on the Ganges in Kuru, who gained a certain fame and following as a teacher, but who is mainly remembered for his failed schemes. The Pali commentaries further specify that the Māgaṇḍiya of [mn75]() is the nephew of the one in the current sutta. ",
  "snp4.9:5.1": "I think the case should be read here as “instrumental of relation”, since the question was not, “how is peace attained”, but “how is it described”. ",
  "snp4.9:5.3": "_Pi_ here doesn’t qualify _sīlabbata_ (per Norman), it co-ordinates with _nopi tena_. I capture this with the not/nor construction. ",
  "snp4.9:10.1": "This verse is quoted and discussed at [sn22.3:1.4](). ",
  "snp4.9:12.3": "_Neyyo_ has the sense “needing to be led”, for example a student who “requires education” before they can master a passage ([an4.133:1.3]()). Here it refers to the arahant. ",
  "snp4.9:12.4": "_Anupanīto_ (“not led in”) relates to _neyyo_ in the previous line. _Anupanīto_ has the sense of “one who has been educated (in recitation)” at [mn93:15.2](). Compare English “brought into the fold”. The sense of “dogma” for _nivesana_ is established at [snp4.3:6.3]() and [snp4.5:6.3](). "
