  "snp4.9:1.3": "The commentary is surely correct in glossing these lines as <i lang='pi' translate='no'><b>kimevidaṁ</b> imissā dārikāya <b>muttakarīsapuṇṇaṁ</b> rūpaṁ</i>. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Idaṁ</i> (neuter) refers to the body (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>) not to the girl. It’s a meaningful distinction; the Buddha was criticizing the nature of the  body, not shaming the person. ",
  "snp4.9:1.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Icche</i> is 1st optative. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Naṁ</i> is rendered as feminine (“her”) by Norman and Bodhi, but it agrees with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ</i> in the previous line, so it should be neuter (“it”). Again, the Buddha says nothing in criticism of the woman, only of the body. ",
  "snp4.9:3.1": "The sense only emerges with the specific nuance of terms. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Niccheyya</i> means to “judge, decide” not simply “consider”; and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samuggahītaṁ</i> means “[a view that is] adopted” (not “assumed” or “grasped”). Finally, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na</i> here applies, not just to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ vadāmi</i>, but also to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samuggahītaṁ</i>, with which <i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ</i> agrees.

  "snp4.9:4.2": "Two Māgaṇḍiyas appear in the Pali canon: here and in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato'>MN 75</a> where he attacks the Buddha as a destroyer of life. As to the protagonist of the current sutta, the Pali commentary, Divyāvadāna 36—which calls him Mākandika—and the Chinese parallel in the Arthapada (T iv 180) say he too hails from the Kuru country, as also at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato'>MN 75</a>. Now, the Mahābhārata and other Sanskrit sources name Mākandī as a city or province on the banks of the Ganges, in the Pañcāla kingdom south of Hastināpura. This more-or-less agrees with Māgaṇḍiya’s home in the Kuru country, and suggests his name means “the man from Mākandī”. Divyāvadāna 36 and Sanskrit fragment say the Mākandika of the current sutta was also a wanderer, which does not contradict the position of the Pali commentaries and the Arthapada that he was a brahmin. At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.294-302/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 5.294–302:1.1</a> <i lang='pi' translate='no'>māgaṇḍika</i> is listed as a type of ascetic; these could well be students of Māgaṇḍiya. Kathāsaritsāgara 15 tells the comic farce of an ascetic from Mākandikā on the banks of the Ganges, who fell in love with the daughter of a merchant and went to ridiculous lengths to obtain her, only to end up a laughing-stock. This story could well have begun life as a comic inversion of this sutta. Reading all these sources together, we can posit that there was a brahmin wanderer from Mākandī on the Ganges in Kuru, who gained a certain fame and following as a teacher, but who is mainly remembered for his failed schemes. The Pali commentaries further specify that the Māgaṇḍiya of <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato'>MN 75</a> is the nephew of the one in the current sutta. ",
