  "snp4.2:2.2": "_Te duppamuñca_ has been taken by most translators as referring to people, in senses either active (Bodhi’s “let go with difficulty”) or passive (Norman’s “are hard to release”). However the phrase occurs in a very similar context at [sn3.10:5.2]() and [dhp346:2](), where it refers to the chains that are hard to escape. ",
  "snp4.2:2.4": "_Jappa_ means both to “incant” and to “long for”, and the English “pray’ has exactly the same connotations—for exactly the same reasons. They originated in begging favors of a god. ",
  "snp4.2:7.1": "The reference here is to the two ends of contact ([an6.61]()) rather than the two extremes of views or paths. ",
  "snp4.2:8.1": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, apparently following the commentary, take _vitareyya_ as an optative. But the previous verse spoke of an arahant, and here the one who has fully understood perception must have already crossed over. _Vitareyya oghaṁ_ occurs at [snp3.5:13.2](), where _vitareyya_ is clearly an absolutive, and is rendered as such by both Bodhi and Norman."
