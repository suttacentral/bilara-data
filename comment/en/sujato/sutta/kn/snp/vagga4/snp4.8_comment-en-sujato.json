  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subha</i>, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”. The same phrase occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.13/en/sujato#16.3'>Snp 4.13:16.3</a>. Perhaps these are ascetics who rely on the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhavimutti</i>, the “beautiful release” (of jhānas). But compare the “ultimate splendor” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paramo vaṇṇo</i>) propounded by the wanderer Sakuludāyī, which seems to have just an idea without any real basis (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn79/en/sujato#9.3'>MN 79:9.3</a>).

It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”. ",
  "snp4.8:11.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sakkhasi</i> is 2nd future, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sampayātave</i> is infinitive. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sampāyati</i> is a fairly common word, “answer a question”, usually in a negative sense, to be “stumped” by a question. Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Ṭhānissaro) don’t catch this sense. "
