  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for _subha_, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”. The same phrase occurs at [snp4.13:16.3](). Perhaps these are ascetics who rely on the _subhavimutti_, the “beautiful release” (of jhānas). But compare the “ultimate splendor” (_paramo vaṇṇo_) propounded by the wanderer Sakuludāyī, which seems to have just an idea without any real basis ([mn79:9.3]()). ",
  "snp4.8:1.4": "Here, as at [snp4.12:15.3](), _puthu_ emphasizes how they all have their own distinct view. ",
  "snp4.8:2.2": "_Dahanti_ is to “regard” or “see”, per Niddesa and Commentary; Bodhi’s “accuse” seems hard to justify. ",
  "snp4.8:10.3": "The Sanskrit here has the name Sīhaśūra. ",
  "snp4.8:11.3": "Here, _yuga_ is connected in the Niddesa with _yugaggāha_ (“taking the reins”), which in turn is connected in [vb17:75.2]() with “causing disputes”. It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”. ",
  "snp4.8:11.4": "_Sakkhasi_ is 2nd future, _sampayātave_ is infinitive. _Sampāyati_ is a fairly common word, “answer a question”, usually in a negative sense, to be “stumped” by a question. Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Ṭhānissaro) don’t catch this sense. "
