  "snp4.15:3.4": "_Osita_ (and _osāna_ in the next line) has the root sense “lay to rest”. Originally it probably meant the place that one laid down one’s burdens at the end of the day (cf. _khema_). From there we see two main applications, to “end” (cf. _pariyosāna_), or to “reside”. The fact that it follows right after the mention of finding “home” in the “world” in an unafflicted “quarter” shows that the sense “reside” applies. Nonetheless, both Norman and Bodhi translate the two occurrences as “unoccupied” and “at the end”, obscuring the fact that they are the same word in different form. Meanwhile Ñāṇadīpa has “obstruct”. In this case the Niddesa’s explanation should be taken as a creative extension of the text.",
  "snp4.15:4.1": "Here, _tveva_ has an adversative sense, “but even then …”. This verse contrasts with the previous, a contrast lost in the translations by Norman, Bodhi, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro, Olendzki, Ireland, Mills, and Hare. Nor is the sense “settlement” for _osāna_ found in DoP, CPD, or PTS Dictionary. So far as I know, the only source with the correct reading of these terms is the Digital Pāli Dictionary.",
  "snp4.15:6.1": "Agreeing with Norman that this line is likely a reciter’s remark. However I take _tattha_ as the locative of reference, else it would be _ettha_. The practical guidelines that follow show how to extract the dart."
