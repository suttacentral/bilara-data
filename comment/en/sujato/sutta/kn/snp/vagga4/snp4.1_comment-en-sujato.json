  "snp4.1:5.3": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all have “enter” here, while Ṭhānissaro has “invades”. But this is a stock line, and it’s hard to read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anveti</i> as anything other than “follows”. Niddesa (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mnd1/en/sujato#70.2'>Mnd 1:70.2</a>) has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anveti anugacchati anvāyikaṁ hoti</i>. The metaphor is not that water “enters” a boat, but that a leaky boat already contains water and takes it along (like a shadow or an ox-cart per the opening verses of the Dhammapada). That’s why it has to be baled out in the next verse. "
