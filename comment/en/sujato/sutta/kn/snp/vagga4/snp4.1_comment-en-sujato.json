  "snp4.1:5.3": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all have “enter” here, while Thanissaro has “invades”. But this is a stock line, and it’s hard to read _anveti_ as anything other than “follows”. Niddesa ([mnd1:70.2]()) has _anveti anugacchati anvāyikaṁ hoti_. The metaphor is not that water “enters” him, but that a leaky boat contains water and takes it along (like a shadow or an ox-cart). That’s why it has to be baled out in the next verse."
