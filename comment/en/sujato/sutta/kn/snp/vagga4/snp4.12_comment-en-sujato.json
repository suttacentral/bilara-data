  "snp4.12:1.3": "Here, as often in the Aṭṭhakavagga, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jānāti</i> implies different ways of knowing, which may be right or wrong (to degrees). We can “see” things differently, but we can’t “know” them differently. ",
  "snp4.12:3.2": "Preferring <i lang='pi' translate='no'>omako</i> over <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mago</i>, which seems a little harsh; <i lang='pi' translate='no'>omako</i> conforms to the principle of least meaning. ",
  "snp4.12:5.1": "I think “this is correct” refers, not to the assertion of a view, but to the assertion that the other is a fool. Niddesa takes it to mean the assertion of one of the 62 views, but this seems to be reading into the text. ",
  "snp4.12:5.2": "Here I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bālā</i> as the quoted speech, as in the lines above and below. The commentary supplies the expected quotation indicator: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>‘bālo’ti āhu</i>. If we take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bālā</i> as subject of the verb here, per Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, then the Buddha is adopting the reductive language of those he seeks to counter, obscuring the sense of the verse. ",
  "snp4.12:5.3": "It’s important to maintain the past sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>akaṁsu</i> here: a view is something they have constructed and built up over time; it has solidified and become part of them, which is why it’s so hard to give up. ",
  "snp4.12:7.2": "The readings and interpretation of this line is tricky; see discussions in Norman and Bodhi. Niddesa and Arthapada are in agreement, and I follow. ",
  "snp4.12:8.3": "Read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>su tāni</i>. ",
  "snp4.12:9.2": "The Niddesa glosses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññatra saññāya niccaggāhā</i>, which is translated by Bodhi as “apart from the grasping of permanence by perception”. But this seems impossible to me: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññāya</i> is an ablative constructed with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññatra</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>niccāni</i> surely agrees with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saccāni</i>. Further, the sense of this reading is a stretch, as we haven’t dealt with impermanence at all so far. I think the allusion is, rather, to the idea of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhammaniyāmatā</i>, the “ﬁxity” or “regularity” of the Dhamma as an “eternal truth”. ",
  "snp4.12:10.1": "This verse begins a rather striking pattern where the first couplet is essentially restated in the second couplet. ",
  "snp4.12:11.1": "Again the two couplets repeat the same meaning. ",
  "snp4.12:13.3": "This must refer back to the previous verse, where <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sayaṁ</i> means “on one’s own account”. ",
  "snp4.12:17.2": "Cf. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na, bhikkhave, dhammavādī kenaci lokasmiṁ vivadati</i>. "
