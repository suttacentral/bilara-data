{
  "snp4.3:1.1": "_Duṭṭhamana_, or more commonly _paduṭṭhamana_, means “malice” not “corruption”, as is found through the suttas and confirmed by the Niddesa. ",
  "snp4.3:2.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render _chanda_ as “desire”, and that is certainly the sense of _chandānunīto_ at [sn35.94:6.4](). Here, however, Niddesa glosses with synonyms for “view” and this seems like a more plausible sense. Note too the sense of _niviṭṭha_ as “dogmatic”, which recurs through the Aṭṭhakavagga (cp. _abhinivesa_). ",
  "snp4.3:2.3": "_Samattāni_ is regularly used of vows “undertaken”, and given the following verse this is surely the meaning here, *contra* Niddesa and commentary. See [snp4.4:5.1](), where _samādāya_ is used in the same sense. ",
  "snp4.3:2.4": "Here we find a sense of _jānāti_ that doesn’t fit the English idea of “knowledge” as “true belief”. The idea is that they speak from their own (limited and opinionated) ideas. It’s not as pejorative as “opinion” nor as solid as “knowledge”, so I render as “notion”. We find this usage commonly in the final two chapters of Snp. ",
  "snp4.3:4.4": "_Ussada_, here rendered “pretension”, is a poetic term with the literal sense of “swelling”. In this chapter it has a close connection with “pride” ([snp4.10:8.4](), [snp4.14:6.4](); cf. the English sense of pride as “protuberance”), although this connection is less obvious elsewhere ([snp3.6:14.4](), [iti97:8.4](), and [ud1.4:2.1]() = [pli-tv-kd1:2.3.6]()). Its absence is a sign of a true brahmin ([mn98:11.19](), [dhp400:2](), [snp3.9:36.1]()). The Niddesa does not link it with pride especially, rather explaining it as sevenfold: greed, hate, delusion, conceit, views, corruptions, and deeds ([mnd10:105.4]()). ",
  "snp4.3:8.3": "The problem addressed is one who is picking up one thing after another. It’s therefore best to translate _atta_ in an active sense, per Niddesa: _gahaṇaṁ muñcanā samatikkanto_. "
