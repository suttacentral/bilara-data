  "snp4.4:1.1": "This line refers to seeing a supposed saint or holy person, a sight that was believed to grant blessings (see [an6.30]()). As Bodhi remarks, _aroga_ refers to the _attā_. However this does not necessarily mean an immaterial soul. Here what is seen is the soul as a physical form (_rūpī attā_) manifesting purity and wellness. ",
  "snp4.4:1.3": "Here as in [snp4.3](), _ñāṇa_ is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking _abhijāna_ in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their vision of a holy man believes that there must be an observer of such purity, i.e. a self. ",
  "snp4.4:1.4": "_Pacceti_ is a standard verb for someone who “believes” in a religious rite or idea. ",
  "snp4.4:4.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render _saṅga_ in some variant of “tie, attachment”. Yet that fails to render the metaphor. _Saṅga_ is used in the sense of a “snare” in which one may be caught, like a net ([snp3.6:28.4]()). And a snare is indeed something that one may cross over or get past. ",
  "snp4.4:4.4": "The monkey grabs the branches, not the trunk, as a metaphor for missing the essence. And to drive home the pun, religious orders are called “branches”. ",
  "snp4.4:5.2": "See _uccāvacaṁ vā pana dassanāya gacchati_ at [an6.30:2.2](). In the current poem, it refers to someone who visits a variety of teachers or sects, as per Niddesa. ",
  "snp4.4:5.3": "Here the plural _vedehi_ stands for the _tevijjā_. ",
  "snp4.4:8.2": "Note that _samuggahīta_ is used here in the same sense as [snp4.3:6.2]() or [snp2.12:11.1](), i.e. the “adoption” of a theory or view. "
