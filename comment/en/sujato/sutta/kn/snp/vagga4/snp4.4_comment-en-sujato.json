  "snp4.4:1.1": "This line refers to seeing a supposed saint or holy person, a sight that was believed to grant blessings. As Bodhi remarks, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aroga</i> refers to the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attā</i>. However this does not necessarily mean an immaterial soul. Here what is seen is the soul as a physical form (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī attā</i>) manifesting purity and wellness. ",
  "snp4.4:1.3": "Here as in 4.3, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ñāṇa</i> is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhijāna</i> in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their vision of a holy man believes that there must be an observer of such purity, i.e. a self. ",
  "snp4.4:1.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pacceti</i> is a standard verb for someone who “believes” in a religious rite or idea. ",
  "snp4.4:4.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all render <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅga</i> in some variant of “tie, attachment”. Yet that fails to render the metaphor. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅga</i> is used in the sense of a “snare” in which one may be caught, like a net (<a href='/snp3.6/en/sujato#28.4'>Snp 3.6:28.4</a>). And a snare is indeed something that one may cross over or get past. ",
  "snp4.4:4.4": "The monkey grabs the branches, not the trunk, as a metaphor for missing the essence. And to drive home the pun, religious orders are called “branches”. ",
