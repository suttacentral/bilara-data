  "snp2.6:1.1": "The titles Dhammacariyasutta and Kapilasutta are both found in manuscripts and commentary. In the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, Dhammacariyasutta is attested both in the concluding title for the sutta and in the summary verse for this chapter ([snp2.14:31.3]()), while Kapilasutta is attested in the summary verse of the Sutta Nipāta as a whole ([snp5.19:22.2](); neither BJT nor PTS has any equivalent for this section so it is probably a late Burmese addition). The BJT has Kapilasutta throughout, while PTS has Dhammacariyasutta throughout, acknowledging Kapilasutta only for the commentary. Given that _kapila_ does not occur in the sutta itself, while _dhammacariya_ occurs in the first line, most likely _kapila_ made its way into the title by contamination from the commentary, which tells an extensive story of a bad monk named Kapila, who the Buddha interrogates after he is reborn as a fish. The Vinaya also knows a monk of dubious morals named Kapila [Bu Pj 2:7.48.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/brahmali#7.48.1). "
