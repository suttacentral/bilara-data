  "snp1.8:1.1": "See [an5.169:3.1]() for this sense of _atthakusala_. ",
  "snp1.8:1.2": "Reading the absolutive in an infinitive sense, per commentery: _abhisamecca viharitukāmena_. ",
  "snp1.8:5.3": "For “have become or will be” (_bhūtā va sambhavesī va_) I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading _sambhavesī_ as a future active participle. Compare such Sanskrit constructions as Rig Veda 1.66.8, _yamo ha jāto yamo janitvaṁ_ (“the twin that is born and the twin about to be born”) and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.3.1.24, _bhūtaṁ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṁ ca janiṣyamāṇaṁ_ (“has become and will be, born and to be born”). ",
  "snp1.8:6.1": "_Nikujjati_ means to “turn upside down”, such as when the Sangha in extreme circumstances may “upturn the bowl” (_pattaṁ nikujjati_). Most translators follow the commentary here (_vañceyya_, “trick, deceive”). However Ñāṇamoḷi has “work another’s undoing”. I think the sense is that one should not turn away from or avert one’s gaze from another. ",
  "snp1.8:10.4": "Note that _jātu_ here is not connected to _jāti_ “birth”. Rather, _na hi jātu_ is an idiom meaning “never”. Commentary: _ekaṃseneva_. "
