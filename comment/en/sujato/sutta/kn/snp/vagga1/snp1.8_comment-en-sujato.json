  "snp1.8:5.3": "For “have become or will be” (_bhūtā va sambhavesī va_) I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading _sambhavesī_ as a future active participle. Compare such Sanskrit constructions as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.3.1.24: _bhūtaṁ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṁ ca janiṣyamāṇaṁ_ (“has become and will be, born and to be born”). ",
  "snp1.8:10.4": "Note that _jātu_ here is not connected to _jāti_ “birth”. Rather, _na hi jātu_ is an idiom meaning “never”. Commentary: _ekaṃseneva_. "
