  "snp1.12:3.1": "The commentary, followed by Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa, all take _pamāya_ here in the sense of “crushed” (Sanskrit: _pramṛṇati_). However, _pamāya_ occurs at [snp4.12:17.1](), where, being beside _vinicchaye_ (“judge, assess”), it is clearly an absolutive of _pamiṇāti_ “having measured”. Here too it sits beside a word (_saṅkhāya_) having the sense to reckon or calculate. In the simile of rebirth and the field, the “seed” is consciousness, which belonging to the first noble truth is not “crushed” but “fully known”. If the seeds are already “crushed” then choosing not to water them (in the next line) is a tad redundant.",
  "snp1.12:3.4": "Compare the stock idiom _Saṅkhampi na upeti upanidhimpi na upeti kalabhāgampi na upeti_ at eg. [sn20.2:1.7](); also [snp5.7:6.3]()."
