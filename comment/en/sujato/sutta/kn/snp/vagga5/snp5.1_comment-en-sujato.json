  "snp5.1:1.3": "_Ākiñcaññaṁ_ (“nothingness”) could mean “owning nothing” or “the dimension of nothingness”, both of which are important topics in the chapters to come. ",
  "snp5.1:2.2": "The inscription Siri Pulumayi at Nasik supports the spelling _muḷaka_. (Sylvain Lévi, “Gonarda, The Cradle of the Gonardiya”, Journal Of The Andhra Historical Society, vol.9, pt.1, July 1934, pg. 8.) ",
  "snp5.1:11.2": "",
  "snp5.1:15.2": "Note that, in the EBTs, _pathavimaṇḍala_ primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”. ",
  "snp5.1:16.1": "_Purā_ can be either “from the city” (Norman), or “formerly” (commentary, followed by Bodhi and Jayawickrama). I think the poet is deliberately echoing the opening line of the text, where it must mean “from the city”. ",
  "snp5.1:17.4": "“He is the one of clear eye regarding all things.” ",
  "snp5.1:21.1": "_Mandira_ is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home. ",
  "snp5.1:21.3": "The commentary gives the senses _vigatadhuro_ “free of burden” (followed by Norman) and _appaṭimo_ “unrivalled” (followed by Bodhi), but at [an3.20:2.1]() it has the sense “indefatigable” and there seems no reason why it shouldn’t have the same meaning here. ",
  "snp5.1:34.3": "Bodhi omits _dhīrā_. ",
  "snp5.1:34.4": "One of the many signs of lateness in this passage. _Vāsana_ in this sense is found only in the very latest strata of canonical and semi-canonical texts such as the Milindapañha, where we find _pubbe vāsitavāsanā_ ([mil6.2.1:3.2]()). ",
  "snp5.1:36.1": "Modern Paithan. ",
  "snp5.1:36.2": "The Sinhalese commentary explains _puri_ or _pura_ as “former”, while the Burmese commentary explains it as “citadel”. The city continued under this name for many centuries, so “former” seems unlikely. It is modern Maheshwar. ",
  "snp5.1:36.3": "Ujjenī is Ujjain. Gonaddhā is not identified, but must have been near Bhopal. ",
  "snp5.1:36.4": "Vedisa is modern Vidisha. Vanasa is called Tumbavana in both inscriptions and Pali commentaries, so may be the modern Tumen. ",
  "snp5.1:37.3": "Bodhi and Norman have Setavya, but [dn23]() shows it is feminine. ",
  "snp5.1:37.4": "See my remarks on _mandira_ above. Kusinārā was famously *not* a city. "
