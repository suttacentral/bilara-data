  "snp5.7:2.3": "This is an abbreviated form of the phrase _natthi kiñcī’ti_ that normally marks the dimension of nothingness.",
  "snp5.7:2.4": "Niddesa explains _kathāhi_ as either “doubts” (hence a truncated form of _kathaṅkathā_), or “talks”; the former is followed by Bodhi, the latter by Norman and Ñāṇadīpa. While “doubts” seems contextually more likely, elsewhere _(paṭi)virato_ is commonly used with speech and never, to my knowledge, with doubt.",
  "snp5.7:6.3": "Compare the stock idiom _Saṅkhampi na upeti upanidhimpi na upeti kalabhāgampi na upeti_ at eg. [sn20.2:1.7](); also [snp1.12:3.4]().",
  "snp5.7:6.4": "_Nāmakāya_ appears only here and in [dn15](), apparently in the same sense. It means neither _nāmarūpa_ nor _manomayakāya_, but rather the “group” of “mental phenomena”. In this case it refers to one who is freed based on a formless attainment, for whom the _rūpakāya_ has been formerly abandoned. "
