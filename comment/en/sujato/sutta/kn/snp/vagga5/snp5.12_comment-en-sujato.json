  "snp5.12:1.4": "While the exact sense of the unique term _sahajanetta_ is open to interpretation, surely Norman’s “omniscient one” (following Niddesa) is not right. ",
  "snp5.12:2.1": "The following line lacks a verb, and Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa all construe it with _abhibhuyya_: the sun “overcomes” the earth. But that doesn’t make sense. Rather, the idiom _abhibhuyya iriyati_ leans on _irayati_ in the sense “to keep going, to proceed”. The Buddha “proceeds” (i.e. keeps living) after mastering desires, like the sun “proceeds” shedding light on the earth. ",
  "snp5.12:3.1": "Niddesa, followed by Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, takes _vinaya_ as optative. But where the same phrase occurs at [kp9:10.3]() and [snp1.8:10.3]() it is clearly absolutive. Moreover, the next includes the absolutive _daṭṭhu_, which elsewhere follows a similar line with an absolutive verb: _kāmesvādīnavaṁ disvā_. ",
  "snp5.12:3.4": "As in the Aṭṭhakavagga, it is essential that this phrase be rendered in an active present tense. It is not that nothing *has ever* been taken up or put down, but that they are no longer actively engaging in taking up and putting down. "
