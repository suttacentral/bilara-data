  "an8.70:3.2": "Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years. ",
  "an8.70:3.6": "i don’t think this phrase literally means he was possessed. Cp. DN 25 ",
  "an8.70:6.3": "BB includes pattayogakkhema. However see the note in text that this phrase does not appear in the SN and Ud parallels for this text. It is also absent from DN16 in our text. PTS is inconsistent, as are manuscripts. It is out of place here, and moreover, unless we are to contradict the rest of the suttas, inapplicable to laypeople, ",
  "an8.70:10.4": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "an8.70:10.5": "_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_. ",
  "an8.70:10.7": "_Attasambhava_ here refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line. ",
  "an8.70:14.3": "So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.” "
