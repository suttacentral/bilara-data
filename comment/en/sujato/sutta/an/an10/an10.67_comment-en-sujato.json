  "an10.67:1.2": "Pali Text Society dictionary correctly says _palāsa_ is *Butea frondosa* (also called *Butea monosperma*). It calls it the Judas tree, but the Judas tree is in fact *Cercis siliquastrum*, which is not native to India. ",
  "an10.67:3.1": "catugguṇaṁ saṅghāṭiṁ paññāpetvā means “having spread out a four-fold sanghati”. BB translates thus in MN, but in SN and AN evidently takes pannapeti to refer to the act of folding rather than spreading. this is unlikely, since pannapeti is the standard term for setting out a seat. If we apply this to folding the robe, then the passages do not actually have the bit about making a seat. Furthermore, in SN he inconsistently takes pannapeti in a causal sense “had his robe folded”, but there are plenty of places that show this cannot work, as for example SN 16.11, where Kassapa obviously spreads out his own folded robe: the only other person present was the Buddha!
