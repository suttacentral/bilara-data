  "an1.576-582:1.1": "Yogakkhema is a hard idiom to get right. I agree with the theory of Witzel, who traces it to an “oasis”, deriving from the very old days of the Indo-euopean wanderers. They’d trudge through the desert and hardlands, and after a very long time they’d come to a lake, an oasis, with grass for the cattle and horses, and shade and water. There they’d stop for the night, make a safe place, and find relief both for themselves and their beasts. This meaning is still prominent in the Jatakas, where a number of the old, mythic Jatakas features a lake Khema that is a sanctuary for living creatures. I translate directly as sanctuary, and use “sanctuary from the yoke” or similar when need in context. ",
  "an1.586-590:1.1": "From here to the end of the Ones, the texts are concatenated ranges. That is, they appear to be a series of separate suttas, but each set contains the main terms in both the beginning and the end. For this reason the range cannot be resolved to its individual members. This varies per edition. In BJT each sutta appears in full, whereas in PTS the texts do not repeat the main terms at the end. The commentary does not decide this matter. ",
  "an1.591-592:1.1": "BB has “differentiation by wisdom” for paññāpabhedāya, but at Snp 1112 avijjāya pabhedana clearly means the “breaking up of ignorance”. "
