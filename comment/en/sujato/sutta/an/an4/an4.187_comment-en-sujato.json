  "an4.187:4.2": "This king appears to be unknown elsewhere. | The ascetic Rāmaputta is probably Uddaka son of Rāma, under whom the Bodhisatta practiced before awakening ([mn26:16.1]()). As to why his assembly disliked Rāmaputta, it may be because he was a contemplative who embraced the renunciate and philosophical path rather than reliance on ritual, which provided brahmins with their income. In coming to his defense, Todeyya represents the forward-looking brahmins of Kosala who, like his peer Pokkharasādi, were more open to such ideas. "
