  "an3.56:2.1": "These three terms recur in a similar context at [dn26:17.16](); the commentaries to the two passages give quite different explanations. “Illicit desire” (_adhammarāgo_) probably refers to any form of desire that is illegal or transgressive, such as incest, rape, or pedophilia. “Immoral greed” (_visamalobho_) implies excess and imbalance. Both are explained in the commentary this passage as desire for the belongings of others. _Micchādhammo_ is hard to pin down. Its opposite, _sammā dhammo_ always means “right teaching”. The commentary at [dn26:17.16]() explains it as homosexuality, but this must be rejected as there is no hint anywhere in early Pali (or elsewhere in early Indian culture) that homosexuality was considered immoral. The commentary here explains it as “indulgence in what is reckoned as an inappropriate basis” (_avatthupaṭisevanasaṅkhātena_). This implies intercourse with one of women mentioned at [mn41:8.4](), which includes those who are “protected by principle” (_dhammarakkhitā_). This sense of _dhamma_ is explained at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.2.16]() as “religion”. Here I think the sense is similar: customs or beliefs that legitimize immorality. "
