  "dn11:3.8": "As noted previously, the basic sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāṭihāriya</i> is “demonstration”, and as the context here shows, it may or may not involve a “demonstration of wonders” i.e. a “miracle”. ",
  "dn11:3.10": "These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth. ",
  "dn11:4.5": "Their priors have been confirmed. ",
  "dn11:5.1": "Note how a skeptical mindset sticks closer to the truth. ",
  "dn11:5.2": "“Spell” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vijjā</i> “(potent) knowledge”. Obviously this spell was associated with the land of Gandhāra  (north-west Pakistan), but otherwise nothing is known about it. ",
  "dn11:5.7": "These feats that have nothing to do with spiritual growth, hence they may be produced or perhaps faked by a variety of means. ",
  "dn11:6.1": "“Revealing” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ādesana</i>, from root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dis</i> “to indicate, show, or point”. ",
  "dn11:6.2": "The Pali terms here are <i lang='pi' translate='no'>citta</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>cetasika</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vitakka</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicāra</i>. ",

The first four <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānas</i> are based on the “subtle form” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhumarūpa</i>) that manifests as light in deep meditation.

  "dn11:68.1": "The mendicant has already well developed the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānas</i>. “Controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm” is one of the “demonstrations of psychic power” listed above. ",
  "dn11:68.2": "The “gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms. ",
  "dn11:68.7": "These are powerful spirits who guard the four quarters. In <a href='/an8.36/en/sujato'>AN 8.36</a> it is explained that they, like the other leading gods mentioned below, achieved their station due to their greater generosity and morality. ",
  "dn11:69.6": "The “Thirty-Three” are mentioned often but not enumerated. The number arises as a reduplication of the trinity. These gods enjoy refined sensual delights. ",
  "dn11:70.6": "Conventionally known as “lord of gods”, but in fact the ruler only of the relatively lowly realm of the Thirty-Three. He is Vedic Indra, and is the most personally known god in the Pali Canon. ",
  "dn11:80.5": "The previous deities achieved their station by mere morality and generosity, not by <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>. The gods of Brahmā’s Host practiced the first <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, but they do not know what lies beyond. ",
  "dn11:80.7": "The same passage appears in <a href='/dn1/en/sujato#2.5.2'>DN 1:2.5.2</a>, where it also had a satirical tone, poking fun at the pomposity of religious titles. ",

  "dn11:83.1": "Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā’s agenda, he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of dealing with a narcissist. ",
  "dn11:83.6": "Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance. This may be a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and leads him aside for a secret discussion. ",
  "dn11:83.9": "At least he is honest about his lack of knowledge, even if not publicly. ",
  "dn11:85.10": "The following verses are difficult and any interpretation is partly conjectural. The problem is that the verses speak of a kind of consciousness at the start, and the cessation of consciousness at the end. The simplest way to resolve this is to assume there are two distinct questions. ",

  "dn11:85.18": "The adjective “infinite” is the direct qualifier of “consciousness”, but in the Pali is shifted to the next line <em>metri causa</em>. This is the dimension of infinite consciousness, one of the formless realms of which Brahmā has no knowledge. ",
