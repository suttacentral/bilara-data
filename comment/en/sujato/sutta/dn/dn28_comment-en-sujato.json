  "dn28:2.12": "Here the additional material begins. While they are all said to be teachings of the Buddha, some sections cannot be traced in the Pali Canon as it stands today. Perhaps Sāriputta was demonstrating his talent for creative rephrasing and synthesis. ",
  "dn28:2.14": "Perhaps a reference to his enlightenment experience in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn74/en/sujato'>MN 74</a>. ",
  "dn28:3.3": "Also at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.50.5'>DN 16:3.50.5</a>, etc. ",
  "dn28:4.2": "The primary source is the SN 35, the Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields. ",
  "dn28:5.3": "The Bodhisatta is said elsewhere to be conceived in awareness (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.15.1'>DN 16:3.15.1</a>), but this systematic analysis is found only here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.11.176'>DN 33:1.11.176</a>. It seems like an abrupt shift from central Dhamma topics. ",
  "dn28:6.2": "Called “demonstrations of revealing” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ādesanāpāṭihāriya</i>) at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.60/en/sujato#9.1'>AN 3.60:9.1</a>. ",
  "dn28:7.3": "Meditation is described in this way only in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn136/en/sujato#9.1'>MN 136:9.1</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.31.1'>DN 1:1.31.1</a> where, as here, it is pursued by an “ascetic or brahmin”, who in those cases is not Buddhist. Here, however, it sounds like Sāriputta is talking about a Buddhist practice. The <i lang='pi' translate='no'>asubha</i> contemplation of the parts of the body is described in several places in the canon (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#5.1'>DN 22:5.1</a>), but never exactly like this. ",
  "dn28:7.8": "The remaining practices are unique to this passage. This is perhaps related to the contemplation of death, as it seems to imply looking at another person’s body rather than one’s own. ",
  "dn28:7.13": "This is a unique description of the process of rebirth. Consciousness is a “stream” in that it flows and moves, ever-changing, and is not a static self-same entity. To be “established” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>patiṭṭhita</i>) is to be attached because of craving. | The phrase “consistent on both sides” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ubhayato abbocchinnaṁ</i>) is unique. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ubhayato</i> is used of “both ends” of a pole <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja533/en/sujato#37.4'>Ja 533:37.4</a>. I think the sense is that one’s consciousness is consistent with regards to this world and the next. If one is attached to this world, one will be attached to the next, and vice versa in the next section. ",

  "dn28:12.1": "The Mahāsaṅgīti omits a heading for this section. ",
  "dn28:12.2": "The sequence from “memory” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satimā</i>) to “retention” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhitimā</i>) is related to the good qualities of Ānanda (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.220/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 1.220:1.1</a>), and pertain to textual fluency. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Satimā</i> here is “memory”, not “mindfulness”, which is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sato</i> at the end.

  "dn28:13.2": "We don’t find this exact passage elsewhere, but it is similar to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.46/en/sujato'>AN 10.46</a>. When the Buddha speaks of future consequences it is conditional. He is not a fortune-teller, but he understands the results of the practice. ",
