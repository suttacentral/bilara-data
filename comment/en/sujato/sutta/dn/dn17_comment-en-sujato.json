  "dn17:1.1.2": "Picking up the story from [dn16:5.17.1](). ",
  "dn17:1.4.1": "From here we leave [dn16]() behind and with it any semblance of realism. Some of these details are shared with [sn22.96](), which however does not mention the name Mahāsudassana. ",
  "dn17:1.5.3": "Readings vary. The Sanskrit text has _saptapauruṣā ardhacaturthapauruṣāś ca nikhātā_. ",
  "dn17:1.6.13": "I think the point is that they listened to the sweet sounds rather than doing worse things. ",
  "dn17:1.7.3": "This is specific instance, so I use past tense. Where it is an abstract description of a legendary past, I use the present tense to denote an eternal or mythic present. ",
  "dn17:1.7.4": "The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the manifestation of unstoppable power. The solar imagery is reflected in the name Mahāsudassana (“Great Splendor”). The whole story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination. ",
  "dn17:1.8.1": "Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the greatest of sovereigns. ",
  "dn17:1.8.3": "In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders on as his. ",
  "dn17:1.9.4": "Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). Translators have rendered these with “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. ",
  "dn17:1.10.1": "The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is born in the western and eastern seas. ",
  "dn17:1.11.1": "I think _upasobhayati_ means to literally “light up”, rather than simply to “beautify”. ",
  "dn17:1.12.2": "The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The description recalls Indra’s elephant Airāvata. For _sattappatiṭṭho_, the commentary has _susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga_ (“well-grounded on each and every limb”), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyavastu which has _saptāṅgaḥ supratiṣṭhito_ (“well-established on seven limbs”). I will leave you to imagine what counts as a limb here, but make no mistake: he was a big boy. ",
  "dn17:1.13.2": "The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a “sky-walker”. “Thundercloud” (_valāhaka_; Sanskrit _balāhaka_) is the name of one of the four horses of Kṛṣṇa’s chariot in the Mahābharata. The description here also recalls the Vedic sacred horse _uccaiḥśravas_. ",
  "dn17:1.23.9": "The jarring inclusion of “women” (_itthī_) in this list probably refers to state-sponsored prostitution. ",
  "dn17:1.24.1": "As at [dn5:19.1](). ",
  "dn17:1.24.2": "",
  "dn17:1.25.2": "The palace is named “Principle” (_dhamma_) in recognition of the king being subject to a higher law. Normally I translate _pāsāda_ as “stilt longhouse” but here something grander is meant. ",
  "dn17:1.26.11": "For _kūṭāgāra_ as “chamber” see _mn37:8.10_. ",
  "dn17:1.26.13": "",
  "dn17:2.1.4": "Thus denying the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa at [dn2:17.5](). This is the recognition, at least partially, of right view. ",
  "dn17:2.1.5": "",
  "dn17:2.2.1": "The _mahāviyūha_ must have been some kind of structure at the entrance to the palace, a “foyer”. ",
  "dn17:2.2.2": "These are the three factors of right thought. The king skillfully uses a transition in physical space to set up his intention to meditate. ",
  "dn17:2.3.1": "Here as in [dn1](), _jhāna_ is not a uniquely Buddhist practice. ",
  "dn17:2.5.4": "This segment breaks the expected pattern of “foremost” things. ",
  "dn17:2.5.7": "Not the British car of the same name. The chariot is the source of victory in battle. ",
  "dn17:2.5.12": "Read _dukūlasandanāni_, where _dukūla_ is “fine cloth, silk” and _sandana_ is “cord, tether”. ",
  "dn17:2.6.3": "An odd detail. Maybe the sound of the elephants disturbed his meditation? ",
  "dn17:2.8.6": "",
  "dn17:2.8.7": "Like Ānanda at [dn16:5.13.1](). ",
  "dn17:2.8.10": "He makes it clear that this will not be an intimate visit. ",
  "dn17:2.10.2": "The aorist is not past tense, as it is governed by _mā_. ",
  "dn17:2.10.4": "“Desire” is _chanda_, the first of the four bases of psychic power, which in [dn16:3.3.1]() are said to lead to long life. By urging him to live long, she inverts the Mahāparinibbānasutta where Ānanda fails to do the same. ",
  "dn17:2.11.3": "Implying that Ānanda was right to not beg the Buddha to live long. ",
  "dn17:2.11.6": "At [an6.16:2.2]() this advice is given by Nakula’s mother. ",
  "dn17:2.12.1": "Like Ānanda at [dn16:5.13.1](). ",
  "dn17:2.13.2": "This contrasts with the Buddha’s last meal \n at [dn16:4.20.1](), which caused sickness and distress. The Buddha was rejecting existence entirely, whereas Mahāsudassana was continuing in a pleasant form of conditioned existence. ",
  "dn17:2.14.3": "After [dn5:21.16](), this is the second Jātaka in the Dīghanikāya. ",
  "dn17:2.15.8": "Accepting the Mahāsaṅgīti’s reading of _vessinī_. I believe the variant _velāmikā_ is a ghost word contaminated from [an9.20:4.1](). "
