  "dn16:1.1.3": "After the events of [dn2](), Ajātasattu was able to retain and consolidate his power. In the decades following the Buddha’s passing, Magadha did indeed swallow up the Vajjian Republic, and continued to expand until almost all of India was under its sway. An important part of this process was the consolidation of shipping routes on the Ganges, which was essential for establishing international trade. ",
  "dn16:1.1.5": "According to the commentary, Ajātasattu’s anger was rooted in a dispute on trade routes. There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajjī. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjans kept absconding with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but is probably Munger, a strategic port east of Patna. The nearby hills have been mined since paleolithic times. ",

  "dn16:1.2.9": "While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even if it is bad news for Ajātasattu. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men. ",

  "dn16:1.4.1": "Ānanda is introduced here caring for the Buddha in his old age. He is the most prominent secondary character throughout this discourse, taking a far more prominent role than a simple interlocuter; he has a special personal relationship with the Buddha. Now, shortly after these events, he was entrusted with the task of reciting the suttas. It seems likely, then, that the first form of this discourse was composed by Ānanda in the years following his Master’s death. This lends a special poignancy to his scenes, as they are imbued with his own emotional struggle to deal with the Buddha’s passing. ",
  "dn16:1.4.3": "As for example at [an8.12:1.2](). ",
  "dn16:1.4.6": "Harmony is especially important as the Vajjian Republic was comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavīs of Vesālī, the Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā, the Jñātṛkas north of Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma, and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. The Videhans of Mithilā are sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. ",
  "dn16:1.4.9": "The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (_porāṇe vajjidhamme_) would have been established with the founding of the Vajjian republic some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (_porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā_ at [an5.191]() and [snp2.7]()), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline. Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjians for their indulgence ([an5.143]()), suggesting that the decline may have already set in. ",

  "dn16:1.5.2": "This event is recorded at [an7.21](), where the Buddha addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate suttas. The Sārandada shrine was short walk from Vesālī ([an5.143]()). ",
  "dn16:1.5.3": "There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not adopt new decrees. It seems that a “decree” (_paññatta_) is more like constitutional law, whereas a “principle” (_dhamma_) is more like a behavioral guideline. ",
  "dn16:1.5.8": "_Upalāpana_ is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at [sn3.25:4.13](), where an enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. ",

",
  "dn16:1.6.12": "The Buddha encouraged the mendicants to recite the Dhamma in harmony ([mn103:3.2]()), to resolve issues in harmony ([mn104:14.3]()), and on the _uposatha_ to recite and train in the _pātimokkha_ in harmony ([As 7:4.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-as7/en/brahmali#4.11)). ",
  "dn16:1.6.13": "Picking up from the similar injunction to the Vajjis, this kicks off a long narrative arc that binds together the Buddha’s invitation to abolish the minor rules ([dn16:6.3.1]()) with the bad monk Subhadda’s seizing on the Buddha’s death as an excuse to give up the rules, which was the direct motivation for the First Council ([dn16:6.20.3]() = [Kd 21:1.1.24](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.1.24)), at the end of which the Sangha agreed not to abolish any rules ([Kd 21:1.9.20](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.9.20)), a decision that was affirmed at the Second Council [Kd 22](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali)).

  "dn16:1.26.3": "The capital of Magadha was moved from the defensively-postured Rājagaha surrounded by hills to the international trading center of Pāṭaliputta. This happened some decades later, however. ",
  "dn16:1.28.7": "From this point, later texts always refer to Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. _Putta_ is used as a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so _pāṭaliputta_ means “a person from Pāṭalī (village)” or as we might say, “Pāṭalian”. As the city became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must have become known as the “city of the Pāṭaliputtas” and hence simply Pāṭaliputta. The commentary explains that _puṭabhedanaṁ_ refers to the “opening of packages”, signifying that it was a center of trade. ",
  "dn16:1.28.9": "Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed of wood, so the danger of fire was real. It is situated on a low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have been an obvious danger.

It is worth noting that no early _anomodanā_ uses the imperative verb form _-tu_ signifying giving a blessing (eg. _bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ_, “may all blessings be”).

  "dn16:3.7.4": "Māra is quoting the Buddha’s words. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha’s awakening. ",
  "dn16:3.8.4": "This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha’s intention from the beginning to establish an order of nuns (_bhikkhunī_). ",
  "dn16:3.9.2": "This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([sn6.1:5.5](), etc.). Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to passing away because of Māra’s request, although his intent was clear earlier. Māra’s reasoning, moreover, is based on the Buddha’s own words. ",
  "dn16:3.10.1": "The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named after the _yakkha_ who formerly lived there. Now, _cāpalla_ means “fickleness, propensity to tremble” and is from the same root as earth-“quake” (_bhumicāla_; _capala_ = _pacala_ via metathesis). It is no great leap to _cāpāla_. If this is correct, it suggests that the shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a fitting setting for the events to follow. ",
  "dn16:3.10.2": "Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if the causes are not scientific. ",
  "dn16:3.10.4": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "dn16:3.10.5": "_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ (“life force”) here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_. ",
  "dn16:3.10.7": "_Attasambhava_ (“self-creation”) refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line. ",
  "dn16:3.13.3": "So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.” ",
  "dn16:3.14.1": "The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [mn56:14.2]()). The meditation described here might be compared with the “dimensions of mastery” below ([dn16:3.25.1]()). ",
  "dn16:3.15.1": "At [dn14:1.17.7]() and [mn123:7.6]() it is, rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the enhanced miracle is a later development. ",

  "dn16:3.18.1": "See [sn56.11:13.2](). ",
  "dn16:3.20.1": "This refers to the Buddha’s death. The Pali here uses both _nibbāna_ and _parinibbāna_. Sometimes it is said that _nibbāna_ is the attainment of arahantship, while _parinibbāna_ is the death of an arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the suttas. Regarding _nibbānadhātuyā_ (“the element of extinguishment”), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes translated “by means of” or “through”, which assumes the instrumental; but the Sanskrit is _nirvāṇadhātau_, which must be locative. ",
  "dn16:3.21.1": "As at [an8.69](). The following series of “eight things” seems arbitrarily inserted here and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are completely absent from the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the Buddha is going to die. ",
  "dn16:3.21.3": "These “assemblies” were formal deliberative meetings, not just gatherings. Thus “householders” here does not mean “lay folk” in apposition to “ascetics”; rather it means “home owners”. Some of these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the Dīghanikāya. At [dn6:1.3](), brahmins assemble in Vesālī; while at [dn3:1.13.3](), Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were aristocrats. At [dn18:12.1](), we get a glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the Thirty-Three. ",
  "dn16:3.22.9": "There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the early texts, although  that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front. The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could plant subtle seeds (_vāsanā_) for the future. ",
  "dn16:3.24.1": "These are another way of describing the different experiences of _jhāna_. Also at [an8.65](), [an10.29:6.1](), [dn33:3.1.142](), [dn34:2.1.160](), and [mn77:23.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.25.1": "“Perceiving form (_rūpa_) internally” refers to someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body, such as the breath or the parts of the body. The “visions” (_rūpā_) seen externally are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are usually called _nimitta_. An “ugly” form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations as the parts of the body. A “beautiful” image arises from practices such as mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "dn16:3.27.1": "“Not perceiving form internally” refers to meditations such as the external elements, or the decaying of another’s body. ",
  "dn16:3.29.1": "This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color, either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a flower, which eventually gives rise to a “counterpart” image. Today such meditations are called _kasiṇa_ following the Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts _kasiṇa_ means “totality” and refers rather to the meditation state of _samādhi_ that results. ",

  "dn16:3.42.2": "A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution. ",
  "dn16:3.42.3": "The traditional site of the First Council, although not mentioned as such in the Vinaya, which simply says it was at  Rājagaha. ",
  "dn16:3.42.4": "A large open area where Jains did their penances ([mn14:15.2]()) and the Buddha taught occasionally ([sn8.10]()), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika ([sn4.23]()) and Vakkali took their lives ([sn22.87]()). ",
  "dn16:3.42.5": "Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the Buddha’s chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([sn10.8]()). But the most famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk Soṇa’s excessive striving ([an6.55](). ",
  "dn16:3.42.6": "The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57]()). They are still in use and just as popular as ever. ",

  "dn16:3.42.9": "Mahākappina stayed here ([pli-tv-kd2:5.3.1]()), and the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove ([sn1.38](), [sn4.13]()). ",
  "dn16:3.45.1": "The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the surrounding land is flat. ([dn24:1.11.5.]()) indicates where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north respectively. ",
  "dn16:3.46.1": "Named after the local _yakkha_, to whom offerings would have been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to lay down a rule permitting three robes [pli-tv-kd8:13.2.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.46.2": "West of Vesālī. The Pali has _amba_ (“mango”) and _ambaka_ (“maiden”) as variants, but the commentary says it was named for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our Buddha. By a strange coincidence, I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the “seven maidens” who gave the island its name. Stories of “seven maidens” are, in fact, widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including the Aboriginal Dreamtime stories.

Earlier avuso was used, but as an indeclinable it doesn’t work in instrumental, so apparently ayasmata is the fallback instrumental form; they are both from the same root.

Walshe more poetically has “To roam the realm of wisdom’s law”. Neither of these agree with comm, which has “Padesavattīti padese vipassanāmagge pavattanto”. However the Sanskrit has āryasya dharmasya pradeśavaktā, where vaktā means “speaker” and pradeśa presumably has the sense “pointing out”. Thus, “I have been the teacher who points out the noble teaching.” While disagreeing in details, this agrees with the thrust of the comm, in that it is to do with teaching.

It seems, therefore, unlikely that the brahmadanda involved actually refusing to speak to him.
