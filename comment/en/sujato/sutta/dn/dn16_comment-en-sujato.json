  "dn16:1.1.3": "After the events of [dn2](), Ajātasattu retained and consolidated his power. Magadha ultimately conquered the Vajji Federation and continued to expand until almost all of India was under its sway. ",
  "dn16:1.1.5": "According to the commentary, Ajātasattu’s anger was rooted in a dispute on trade routes. Control of shipping on the Ganges was essential for establishing international trade. There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajji. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjis kept absconding with the whole lot. The place is not identified, but Munger, a strategic port east of Patna, fits the description. The nearby hills have been mined since paleolithic times. It is also likely, as maintained in Jain tradition, that the Vajjis disputed Ajātasattu’s accession after committing regicide. His threatening posture towards the Vajjis is also mentioned in [sn20.8:2.2](). ",
  "dn16:1.2.1": "Vassakāra appears in the suttas as a devoted follower of the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:1.2.7": "The Vajji Federation harks back to an early settlement founded by the legendary Nābhānediṣṭha in the Vedic period. It built its wealth on its extensive fertile plains and the trading possibilities opened up by the Gandak and Ganges rivers. ",
  "dn16:1.2.9": "While it may seem strange to consult the Buddha on such a violent plan, Ajātasattu knows from his experience in DN 2 that the Buddha will not hesitate to tell him the truth, even if it is bad news. It seems he is trying to avoid the downfall of tyrants who are surrounded only with yes men. ",
  "dn16:1.3.1": "Reading _yojapetvā_ (“had them harnessed”), which is found in the Mahāsaṅgīti in similar passages, and in this passage in the PTS edition. ",
  "dn16:1.4.1": "Ānanda cares for the Buddha in his old age. Shortly after these events, Ānanda was entrusted with reciting the suttas at the First Council. This discourse would have been composed by him in the years following his Master’s death. More than a simple interlocutor, Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character with an empathetic point of view. He imbues the discourse with his emotional struggles as he deals with the Buddha’s passing and helps ensure the future survival of the Dhamma, while still developing his own meditation practice. ",
  "dn16:1.4.3": "As for example at [an8.12:1.2](). ",
  "dn16:1.4.6": "Harmony is especially important as the Vajji Federation was comprised of several different clans, among them the Licchavis of Vesālī, the Ñātikas just south of Vesālī, the Uggas of Hatthigāma (Elephant Village), and the Bhogas of Bhoganagara. Some sources say the Vajjis proper were another tribe within the alliance. The Videhans of Mithilā are also sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a closely allied independent republic ([mn35:12.8]()). ",
  "dn16:1.4.9": "The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (_porāṇe vajjidhamme_) would have been established with the founding of the Vajji Federation some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (_porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā_ at [an5.191]() and [snp2.7]()), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline. Similarly, the Buddha elsewhere scolds the Vajjis for their indulgence ([an5.143]()), suggesting that the decline may have already set in. ",
  "dn16:1.4.15": "This advocates for legal protection for women from sexual violence. | For various legal regulations regarding women and sex, see Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra 12. ",
  "dn16:1.4.18": "The Buddha will stay at several of these shrines later in this discourse. They were sacred groves, maintained by the people in reverence for the powerful spirits of nature. | “Spirit-offerings” is _bali_. | The commentary explains “inner or outer” as inside or outside the town. ",
  "dn16:1.4.21": "It is an old Indian belief that the presence of holy persons provides a kind of umbrella effect that protects the realm. ",
  "dn16:1.5.2": "This event is recorded at [an7.21](), where the Buddha addresses the Licchavis. That chapter of the Aṅguttara mostly consists of the teachings found here presented as separate suttas. | The Sārandada shrine was short walk from Vesālī ([an5.143]()). ",
  "dn16:1.5.3": "There is a certain tension here: the Buddha taught these principles to the Vajjis, one of which is that the Vajjis should not adopt new decrees. It seems that a “decree” (_paññatta_) is more like constitutional law, whereas a “principle” (_dhamma_) is more like a behavioral guideline. ",
  "dn16:1.5.8": "_Upalāpana_ is used a number of times in the Vinaya, where it always has the sense of giving someone something to get them to do what you want. It has the same sense at [sn3.25:4.13](), where an enemy king may be bribed with gold from the royal treasury. | The commentary says that Vassakāra himself was assigned with the task of weakening the Vajjis in this way. ",
  "dn16:1.6.2": "There were several monasteries and hermitages around Rājagaha ([pli-tv-kd2:11.1.1]()). ",
  "dn16:1.6.7": "Also at [an7.23](). ",
  "dn16:1.6.11": "This especially refers to the fortnightly _uposatha_. Despite the dangers faced in the rugged hills around Rājagaha ([pli-tv-kd2:12.1.1]()), the Buddha insisted that all monks of the locality attended the _uposatha_ ([pli-tv-kd2:5.3.1]()). ",
  "dn16:1.6.12": "The Buddha encouraged the mendicants to recite the Dhamma in harmony ([mn103:3.2]()), to resolve issues in harmony ([mn104:14.3]()), and on the _uposatha_ to recite and train in the _pātimokkha_ in harmony ([pli-tv-bu-vb-as7:4.11]()). ",
  "dn16:1.6.13": "Picking up from the similar injunction to the Vajjis, this kicks off a long narrative arc that binds together the Buddha’s invitation to abolish the minor rules ([dn16:6.3.1]()) with the bad monk Subhadda’s seizing on the Buddha’s death as an excuse to give up the rules, which was the direct motivation for the First Council ([dn16:6.20.3]() = [pli-tv-kd21:1.1.24]()), at the end of which the Sangha agreed not to abolish any rules ([pli-tv-kd21:1.9.20]()), a decision that was affirmed a century later at the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd22]()). ",
  "dn16:1.6.14": "The nature of seniority in the Saṅgha is often misunderstood. There is no “hierarchy” (literally “rule of priests”) in the sense of power-based relationships: no monastic has the authority to command another monk or nun. Seniority is owed respect, not obedience. ",
  "dn16:1.6.15": "This stands in place of the injunction against sexual violence, both principles being concerned with the harmful effects of desire. ",
  "dn16:1.6.16": "This stands in place of the injunction to maintain the shrines, where mendicants would frequently stay. ",
  "dn16:1.6.17": "This stands in place of the injunction to look after arahants. ",
  "dn16:1.7.1": "Also at [an7.24](). ",
  "dn16:1.7.4": "“Work” is _kamma_, which especially means “building work”. Of course it is essential to do work, but one should not get too caught up in it. The Buddha did not believe that working hard was ennobling in and of itself. ",
  "dn16:1.7.8": "“Corrupt wishes” (_pāpicchā_) is defined as when a faithless person wishes to be known as faithful, or person otherwise lacking good qualities wishes to be known as having them ([an10.23:6.2]()). ",
  "dn16:1.7.10": "This item and the preceding two were the downfall of Devadatta ([iti89]()). ",

  "dn16:1.8.11": "Also at [an7.26](). ",
  "dn16:1.10.2": "As at [an7.27](). These “perceptions” are all meditation practices which are described at [an10.60](). ",
  "dn16:1.11.1": "These six principles are found in several places, but they are not elsewhere called “principles that prevent decline”; for example at [an6.11]() they are called “warm-hearted qualities” (_dhammā sāraṇīyā_). At [an6.22](), however, a different six qualities are called “principles that prevent decline”: not relishing work, talk, sleep, and company, being easy to admonish, and having good friends. ",
  "dn16:1.11.9": "This is the right view of the noble eightfold path, in other words, the four noble truths. ",
  "dn16:1.12.1": "This epitome of the Dhamma is repeated eight times in this discourse, summarizing the teachings in the Gradual Training. It is not found in this exact form elsewhere. ",
  "dn16:1.12.3": "“Imbued” (_paribhāvita_) as a mother hen imbues her eggs with warmth by sitting on them ([an7.71:2.2]()). See also [sn55.21:2.3](). ",
  "dn16:1.12.6": "Some editions add _diṭṭhāsava_ (“defilement of views”), but since that appears to be a late interpolation I follow the Mahāsaṅgīti in omitting it. ",
  "dn16:1.13.2": "This is the same rest-house at which the Buddha sojourned on his way from Rājagaha to Nāḷandā in the Brahmajālasutta ([dn1]()). ",
  "dn16:1.16.1": "This was apparently the last time that the Buddha met Sāriputta. This encounter is recorded in an independent sutta at [sn47.12]() and expanded into a long discourse at [dn28](). The Saṁyutta follows this meeting with the record of Sāriputta’s passing at [sn47.13](), and then the lament for the absence of both Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn47.14 ](). For some reason these events were omitted from the present discourse, even though they fit well thematically. ",
  "dn16:1.17.2": "As at [dn14:1.37.4](), inference (_anvaya_) is regarded as a valid form of knowledge. The Buddha himself is said to rely on inference using the same simile at [an10.95:10.4](). ",
  "dn16:1.19.2": "This is modern Patna. In this account we see how it was developed from the simple riverside village of Pāṭaligāma to the citadel of Pāṭaliputta. Ajātasattu ultimately moved the capital of Magadha from the defensively-postured Rājagaha surrounded by hills to this trading center on open waters. Under Ashoka it became one of the greatest cities of the ancient world. It was named after the _pāṭalī_ tree (*Stereospermum chelonoides*), known as *patala* in Hindi. ",
  "dn16:1.23.2": "Also at [an5.213](), [ud8.6:4.1](), [dn33:2.1.36](), and [pli-tv-kd1:28.4.1](). ",

  "dn16:1.25.4": "_Suññāgāra_ normally means an “empty dwelling”, but here the commentary describes it as a curtained-off cubicle. ",
  "dn16:1.26.1": "Vassakāra was no dawdler, as he preceded the Buddha to Pāṭaligāma. And not long after, he returned to Rājagaha to build more fortifications there ([mn108:6.2]()). | _Nagara_ here means “citadel, fortress”, not “city”. It has the same sense as _pura_. The construction is defensive and may well have begun before Ajātasattu began thinking of invading. ",
  "dn16:1.26.2": "The relation between deities and building sites (_vatthu_) appears only in this passage in the early texts (repeated at [ud8.6:15.2]() and [pli-tv-kd1:28.7.3]()). Divination and geomancy (_vatthuvijjā_) for building sites is said to be a wrong livelihood at [dn1:1.21.2](). ",
  "dn16:1.26.3": "",
  "dn16:1.28.7": "From this point, later texts always refer to Pāṭaliputta, but the reason for the change of name from Pāṭaligāma is not explained in the commentary. _Putta_ is a suffix indicating the people of a certain clan or place, so _pāṭaliputta_ means “a person from Pāṭalī (village)” or as we might say, “Pāṭalian”. As the city became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must have become known as the “city of the Pāṭaliputtas” and hence simply Pāṭaliputta. Compare the uses of _ñātika_ below. | The commentary explains that _puṭabhedanaṁ_ refers to the “opening of packages”, signifying that it was a center of trade. This usage is attested as late as the 13th century Jain Vividhatīrthakalpa of Jinaprabhasūri. ",
  "dn16:1.28.9": "Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed of wood, so the danger of fire was real. It is situated on a low-lying flood plain of the Ganges, so flooding would also have been an obvious danger. As for dissension (_mithubheda_), Vassakāra had indicated that this was a means of bringing down the Vajjis, so it would seem that kamma was lying in wait for them. ",
  "dn16:1.31.1": "This is the _anumodanā_ recited for the meal offering. Other examples are found at [snp3.7:34.3]() = [mn92:25.6](), [sn55.26:20.1](), [pli-tv-kd1:15.14.4](), and [pli-tv-kd1:1.5.1](). | It is worth noting that no early _anomodanā_ uses the imperative verb form _-tu_ signifying giving a blessing (eg. _bhavatu sabbamaṅgalaṁ_, “may all blessings be”).

  "dn16:1.32.3": "The “ford” (_tittha_) is symbolic; those who forge a path to salvation are called _titthakara_, such as the six leading ascetics of [dn2](). Today there is a 5.7 km bridge at this crossing, which is appropriately called the Mahatma Gandhi Setu. ",

  "dn16:2.1.2": "Koṭigāma lay a short distance from the Ganges. The Buddha’s stay here must therefore have followed the events of [sn47.14]() at Ukkacelā on the Vajjian bank of the Ganges, where he laments the passing of Sāriputta and Moggallāna. He would have heard of Sāriputta’s passing before then, while on the road from Nāḷandā to Pāṭaligāma, even though that is implausibly said to have happened at Sāvatthī ([sn47.13]()). ",

Thus Ñātika is first of all a name of a clan, then the land they live in, then their chief town. | Over a millennium previously, the Indus Valley Civilization had built cities of fired brick with standardized size and construction methods, but in the Buddha’s day most buildings were wood. This is the only brick building mentioned in the suttas; brick construction is also discussed in the Vinaya. ",
  "dn16:2.6.2": "It is unprecedented to discuss the spiritual destinies of an entire town like this. Normally this question is only asked when specific individuals known to the Buddha have passed away.

The point is not whether you receive an ordination, but whether you let go of attachments. ",
  "dn16:2.7.15": "The commentary to the Saṁyutta attributes the large number of deaths to a recent plague (_ahivātaroga_, “viper’s breath disease”).

Each of these stages is further subdivided into those of the path who are practicing for realization and those of the fruit who have realized.

  "dn16:2.26.1": "This central theme of the Buddha’s teaching—that each of us is responsible for our own salvation—becomes even more important as the Buddha’s days grow short. ",
  "dn16:2.26.8": "Read _tama(t)agge_ with _tama_ as superlative, literally “at the peak of the best”. ",
  "dn16:3.1.3": "This detail is often mentioned in texts of the Sarvāstivāda school, but rarely in Pali. ",
  "dn16:3.3.1": "Normally _kappa_ as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu ([Kv 11.5](https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5)) and Milindapañha ([Mil 5.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10)) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years. ",
  "dn16:3.4.3": "Here Ānanda’s mind is “as if” possessed (_yathā_), but in the Vinaya _yathā_ is missing: he is possessed ([pli-tv-kd1:1.10.17]()). Remember, Ānanda is telling this story about himself. ",
  "dn16:3.7.1": "Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but this sequence is his only direct appearance in the Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for with the Buddha’s passing Māra’s job will be much easier. ",
  "dn16:3.7.2": "_Parinibbāna_ means “extinguishment”, as of a flame. Here it appears as both noun (“extinguishment”) and verb (“become extinguished”). It is not a particularly difficult term to translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with “attachment”, so renderings such as “unbinding” are untenable. It should be translated rather than just keeping “Nibbāna”, not least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in such constructions as “enter Nibbāna”, which reifies it in a way that the Pali does not. ",
  "dn16:3.7.4": "Māra is citing the Buddha’s words for his own purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha’s awakening. ",
  "dn16:3.8.4": "This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha’s intention from the beginning to establish an order of nuns (_bhikkhunī_). ",
  "dn16:3.9.2": "This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([sn6.1:5.5](), etc.). Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to passing away because of Māra’s request, although his intent was clear earlier. Māra’s reasoning, moreover, is based on the Buddha’s own words. ",
  "dn16:3.9.3": "It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the rains in Beluva village, from where he would sometimes go to nearby Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation. He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the rains ([dn16:4.1.2]()). If this reasoning is correct—and the text is not explicit—then he made this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. This conflicts with the tradition of ascribing his final extinguishment to the full moon of Vesak, in May. ",
  "dn16:3.10.1": "The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named after the _yakkha_ who formerly lived there. Now, _cāpalla_ means “fickleness, propensity to tremble” and is from the same root as earth-“quake” (_bhumicāla_; _capala_ = _pacala_ via metathesis). It is no great leap to _cāpāla_. If this is correct, it suggests that the shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a fitting setting for the events to follow. ",
  "dn16:3.10.2": "Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if the causes are not scientific. ",
  "dn16:3.10.4": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. | _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "dn16:3.10.5": "_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ (“life force”) here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_. ",
  "dn16:3.10.7": "_Attasambhava_ (“self-creation”) refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line. ",
  "dn16:3.13.3": "So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.” ",
  "dn16:3.14.1": "The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [mn56:14.2]()). The meditation described here might be compared with the “dimensions of mastery” below ([dn16:3.25.1]()). ",
  "dn16:3.15.1": "At [dn14:1.17.7]() and [mn123:7.6]() it is, rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the enhanced miracle is a later development. ",
  "dn16:3.17.1": "There are many accounts of the Buddha’s awakening in the suttas, but none, so far as I know, that mention an earthquake. ",
  "dn16:3.18.1": "See [sn56.11:13.2](). ",
  "dn16:3.20.1": "This refers to the Buddha’s death. The Pali here uses both _nibbāna_ and _parinibbāna_. Sometimes it is said that _nibbāna_ is the attainment of arahantship, while _parinibbāna_ is the death of an arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the suttas. | Regarding _nibbānadhātuyā_ (“the element of extinguishment”), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes translated “by means of” or “through”, which assumes the instrumental; but the Sanskrit is _nirvāṇadhātau_, which must be locative. ",
  "dn16:3.21.1": "As at [an8.69](). The following series of “eight things” seems arbitrarily inserted here and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are absent from the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the Buddha is going to die. ",
  "dn16:3.21.3": "These “assemblies” were formal deliberative meetings, not just gatherings. Thus “householders” here does not mean “lay folk” in apposition to “ascetics”; rather it means “home owners”. Some of these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the Dīghanikāya. At [dn6:1.3](), brahmins assemble in Vesālī; while at [dn3:1.13.3](), Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were aristocrats. At [dn18:12.1](), we get a glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the thirty-three. ",
  "dn16:3.22.9": "There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the early texts, although  that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front. The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could plant subtle seeds (_vāsanā_) for the future. ",
  "dn16:3.24.1": "These are another way of describing the different experiences of _jhāna_. Also at [an8.65](), [an10.29:6.1](), [dn33:3.1.142](), [dn34:2.1.160](), and [mn77:23.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.25.1": "“Perceiving form (_rūpa_) internally” refers to someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body, such as the breath or the parts of the body. The “forms” (_rūpā_) seen externally are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are usually called _nimitta_. An “ugly” form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations as the parts of the body. A “beautiful” image arises from practices such as mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "dn16:3.27.1": "“Not perceiving form internally” refers to meditations such as the external elements, or the decaying of another’s body. ",
  "dn16:3.29.1": "This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color, either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a flower, which eventually gives rise to a “counterpart” image. Today such meditations are called _kasiṇa_ following the Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts _kasiṇa_ means “totality” and refers rather to the state of _samādhi_ that results. ",
  "dn16:3.33.1": "Already encountered at [dn15:35.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.40.1": "Note that this is the idiom that Ānanda uses when directly quoting the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:3.40.6": "“Misdeed” is _dukkaṭaṁ_. This term is familiar as the most minor class of offences in the Vinaya. Here we see an informal use of the term as something that has been wrongly done, rather than a legal violation. It is used in a similar way by Mākassapa at the First Council, who accuses Ānanda of several misdeeds. As a legal term, _dukkaṭa_ is late; the category of offences is not found in the Vinayas of the Mahāsaṅghika group of schools, which use _vinayatikkrama_ for a similar idea. ",
  "dn16:3.41.1": "The Buddha goes on to list multiple places where he hinted to Ānanda, but the only record of such a conversation is at the Cāpāla Shrine. ",
  "dn16:3.42.1": "The following group of places are all near Rājagaha, and collectively illustrate the variety of dwellings and environs enjoyed by the mendicants practicing there. | The Gotama banyan tree shrine is mentioned only here. Gotama is a common name, and this shrine does not appear to have any connection with the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:3.42.2": "A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution. ",
  "dn16:3.42.3": "The Pali tradition says the First Council was held near the entrance to this cave  (Dīpavaṁsa 4.19, Mahāvaṁsa 3.19, Samantapāsādikā Paṭhamamahāsaṅgītikathā). The Vinayas all agree that it was at Rājagaha, but traditions vary as to the exact location. ",
  "dn16:3.42.4": "A large open area where Jains did their penances ([mn14:15.2]()) and the Buddha taught occasionally ([sn8.10]()), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika ([sn4.23]()) and Vakkali took their lives ([sn22.87]()). ",
  "dn16:3.42.5": "Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the Buddha’s chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([sn10.8]()). But the most famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk Soṇa’s excessive striving ([an6.55]()). ",
  "dn16:3.42.6": "The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57]()). They are still in use and just as popular as ever. ",
  "dn16:3.42.7": "A personal gift of King Bimbisāra, this was the first permanent monastery offered to the Buddha and his Saṅgha ([pli-tv-kd1:22.17.3]()). ",
  "dn16:3.42.9": "Mahākappina stayed here ([pli-tv-kd1:5.3.1]()), and the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove ([sn1.38](), [sn4.13]()). ",
  "dn16:3.45.1": "The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the surrounding land is flat. [dn24:1.11.5]() indicates where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north respectively. | _Udena_ is an epithet of the “arising” sun (Rig Veda 1.48.7), although here it may have the sense “prosperity”. ",
  "dn16:3.46.1": "Named after the local _yakkha_, to whom offerings would have been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to lay down a rule permitting three robes ([pli-tv-kd1:13.2.1]()). A short but galaxy-shaking discourse was once taught there ([an3.125:0.3]()). ",
  "dn16:3.46.2": "The Pali has _amba_ (“mango”) and _ambaka_ (“maiden”) as variants. The commentary supports the latter, saying it was named for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our Buddha. I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the “seven maidens” who gave the island its name. Stories of “seven maidens” are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the seven sisters was lost. In the Buddhist telling this is Visākhā, the only sister not to become an arahant in this life. ",
  "dn16:3.46.3": "This was, obviously, a fertility shrine. ",
  "dn16:3.46.4": "Previously mentioned as the place where the seven principles of non-decline were taught to the Licchavis. The meaning of Sārandada is obscure and variants profligate, but it might be derived from the Munda word _sara_, “funeral pyre”. The commentary says it was taken over from an old shrine to a _yakkha_ of that name. ",
  "dn16:3.48.7": "“Take back” is _paccāvamissati_, which has several variants. It occurs in [ja69]() and [ja509](), where it is the opposite of _vamati_, to “expel, vomit”. ",
  "dn16:3.48.8": "This was the major Saṅgha residence near Vesālī. The Great Wood, according to the commentary, stretched as far as the Himalayas. Later tradition says that a town should have three woods: a “great wood” for wilderness (_mahāvana_); a “prosperity wood” for resources (_sirivana_); and an “ascetic wood” for spiritual practice (_tapovana_).

  "dn16:3.50.3": "Memorization was considered an essential basis for learning. In similar passages, we also find the injunction to “recite” the teachings, thus authorizing the recitation of the Buddha’s teachings after his death, which was later formalized in the Councils (_saṅgīti_). ",
  "dn16:3.50.5": "These are the sets of practices later called the 37 _bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā_, the “wings to awakening”. Here they are presented as an essential summary of the Buddha’s teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring to the earliest recension of this text.

There is a nuance in meaning here, because while _apalokana_ literally means to “look back”, it is used in the sense to “take leave” before setting out on a journey. ",
  "dn16:4.1.4": "_Bhaṇḍagāma_, where _bhaṇḍa_ means “wares”; it must have been a trading post. It seems the villages in this passage were named after their chief economic activity, so I translate them to highlight this pragmatic system. ",

They are more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a legitimate legal procedure ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:2.1.8]()). Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that _dhamma_ and _sutta_ are different words, we should not take _dhamma_ and _vinaya_ here as equivalent to _sutta_ and _vinaya_ below.

The late canonical Netti explains _sutta_ as “the four noble truths” and _vinaya_ as “the removal of greed, hate, and delusion” ([ne6]()). The commentaries discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti for _vinaya_, but say _sutta_ means the entire Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings should “fit in” with the four noble truths (like other footprints fit in to an elephant’s footprint, [mn28]()), and they should “be exhibited” in that the results of practice should be apparent (_sandiṭṭhika_). | “Memorize” (_uggahetvā_), because in an oral tradition a text is not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken seriously. | “Fit into” is _osāreti_ or _otāreti_ per [an4.180](); the two words have a similar meaning, “to flow down into”.

  "dn16:4.8.6": "The text has _ca_ (“and”) rather than _vā_ (“or”), which would be expected if they were to be found in one or other textual collection. This is urging that any teaching fits in with the fundamental principles of the four noble truths, and is effective in removing defilements. ",

It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for if the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). In the case of a correct passage we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases. ",
  "dn16:4.9.2": "Each of the four references is a little less solid than the previous. Here one hasn’t heard from the Buddha, but from the Saṅgha. The fact that one hears it from the Saṅgha implies a kind of formal group recitation such as a _saṅgīti_ or “council”. ",

Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks: thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a particularly strong discourse ([sn15.13]()); Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha’s passing at Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with monks of “Avanti and the south” arguing for strict Vinaya in the Second Council ([pli-tv-kd1:1.7.11]()).

It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become tender and “high” for extra flavor when cooked.

Mahācunda was one of the great disciples ([mn118:](), [an6.17](), [mn8]()), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs ([an6.46](), [an10.24]()). He once stayed with Channa and Sāriputta ([mn144:4.1](), [sn35.87:1.2]()); the commentaries say he was in fact Sāriputta’s younger brother. They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta ([sn47.13:1.3]()) and Mahāvīra ([dn29:2.1](), [mn104:3.1]()), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person, but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda ([tha-ap52:13.3]()). Thus there may have been one person known by different names, or several people whose stories have become conflated. ",

  "dn16:4.42.8": "Again, the narrative circle. ",
  "dn16:4.42.12": "The text uses _āyasmā_ here for Cunda, as does the Sanskrit, whereas it is normally reserved for mendicants (see below, [dn16:6.2.1]()). ",

  "dn16:5.2.1": "Sal trees blossom in April/May. This detail agrees with the Buddha’s final extinguishment in December/January, rather than in May (Vesak) as is currently celebrated (see note to [dn16:3.9.3]()). ",
  "dn16:5.3.9": "This calls back to the description of the fourfold assembly in the Māra section above ([dn16:3.7.4]()). ",
  "dn16:5.3.10": "This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the Buddha’s teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that such things were of limited worth compared with practice. ",
  "dn16:5.4.1": "Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an attendant with Ānanda; at [dn29:41.1]() he is also fanning the Buddha. At [an5.166](), Ānanda goes to Upavāna for support when he feels he has disappointed the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:5.4.5": "In [sn7.13]() Upavāna fetched hot water and molasses for the Buddha, an event he remembered in his own verses at [thag2.33](). ",
  "dn16:5.5.8": "For this usage of _phuṭo_, see [an3.56:1.3](). ",
  "dn16:5.6.2": "Elsewhere, _pathavīsaññī_ refers to those who develop a form of meditation where they are “percipient of earth” ([an10.6:1.2]()). Here, however, it simply means those deities who are aware of events on the ground. | Read _chinnaṁpādaṁ viya papatanti_. ",
  "dn16:5.6.3": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14). See [snp3.9:11.1]() = [mn98:7.23](). | Pali has _cakkhuṁ loke_ (“eye in the world”), Sanskrit has _cakṣur lokasya_ (“eye of the world”). ",
  "dn16:5.6.7": "These two reactions—grief and equanimity—are depicted often in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition, feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher, developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive, resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine. A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system analyzing the impermanence of “conditions”, leading to the Abhidhamma. ",
  "dn16:5.7.1": "As for example at [mn24:2.1](). ",
  "dn16:5.7.2": "_Manobhāvanīya_ is explained in the commentaries as “those who, when seen, cause the mind to grow in what is skillful.” ",
  "dn16:5.8.1": "These four sites are the primary destinations of modern Buddhist pilgrims in India. | _Saṁvejanīya_ is “stirring, provoking inspiration or urgency” such as when seeing an astonishing, disturbing, or amazing sight. ",
  "dn16:5.8.3": "Lumbinī in modern Nepal, which today is a well-maintained and quiet place for devotion and meditation. The site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after this time. On the pillar is inscribed in Brahmī characters _hida bhagavaṁ jāte ti_, which is a direct quote in Māgadhī of the Pali phrase here, _idha tathāgato jāto ti_. (_Tathāgata_ “realized one” is how the Buddha referred to himself, while _bhagavā_ “blessed one” is how his followers referred to him.) This is the oldest direct quote from the early canon preserved in the archaeological record. ",
  "dn16:5.8.4": "Bodhgaya in modern Bihar, which is called Uruvelā in the Pali texts. It is a bustling center for pilgrims from all over the Buddhist world, at the center of which is the great stupa next to the Bodhi tree. ",
  "dn16:5.8.5": "Isipatana is modern Sarnath, in the northern part of Varanasi on the Ganges. In the temple next to the park, the first sermon is recited every night. | Note the passive voice, whereas the parallel at [an4.118]() is active. ",
  "dn16:5.8.6": "The phrase _nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto_, “fully quenched in the element of extinguishment” shows how the Pali uses two roots simultaneously for Nibbana. The better-known term, _nibbāna_ (Sanskrit _nirvāṇa_), is from the root _vā_ (“to blow”), with the basic sense of going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form _nibbuta_ (Sanskrit _nirvṛta_), from the root _var_ (“to check or restrain”), has the basic sense of freedom from obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats _nibbuta_ as the past participle form of _nibbāna_, and for the most part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana. “Quenched” means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using _nirvṛta_, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great divinity. By using “extinguishment” for _nibbāna_ and “quenched” for _nibbuta_ I hope to express this subtle distinction, or at least to alert the reader that it exists. ",
  "dn16:5.9.1": "This passage is absent from the Sanskrit parallel and it is probably a late interpolation. Ānanda was handsome, and many stories of his encounters with women are preserved, for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.5](). ",
  "dn16:5.9.2": "As it stands, this appears to contradict [mn152:2.10](), where the Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing. The commentary, however, explains it as not looking at a woman who is standing in the doorway of a monk’s hut, so as not to give rise to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an unusually intimate encounter. ",
  "dn16:5.9.3": "The verb changes from _paṭipajjāma_ (first person plural) to _paṭipajjitabbaṁ_ (future passive participle), a shift that mirrors the following passage regarding the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out the funeral, whereas here that does not apply. This suggests that this passage has been derived from that later passage. ",
  "dn16:5.9.4": "The commentary refers to [an5.55:6.5](), which speaks of chatting alone in private with a woman, a circumstance also dealt with in [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45](). ",
  "dn16:5.9.5": "Ānanda does not hesitate to let the Buddha know he has no intention of following his advice. ",
  "dn16:5.9.6": "The commentary says, quoting [sn35.127:1.6](), that when a woman has sincere motivations, one should speak while thinking of them as a mother, a sister, or a daughter. ",
  "dn16:5.10.1": "“Corpse” is _sarīra_. ",
  "dn16:5.10.2": "For _abyāvaṭā_ (“don’t get involved”), compare _samaṇena bhavitabbaṁ abyāvaṭena_ (“a monastic shouldn’t get involved” (in domestic matters)) at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.34](). ",
  "dn16:5.10.3": "Read _sadatthe_ (“own goal”) rather than _sāratthe_ (“essential goal”). ",
  "dn16:5.11.5": "An iron case was also used for Queen Bhaddā’s body at [an5.50:1.6](). The second iron case does not “enclose” the first; rather it “crooks” (_paṭikujjati_) like a lid to “close it up”. ",
  "dn16:5.12.3": "Buddhist monuments were round in shape, which was apparently a characteristic of the lands around Magadha. Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 13.8.1.5 says that the correct form of such a monument was square, and that round monuments were built by godless “easterners”. ",
  "dn16:5.12.8": "“Independent Buddhas” are sages who discover the Dhamma and are awakened independently, but who do not themselves go on to found a dispensation or establish a monastic order. Text has _paccekasambuddho_ rather than the usual _paccekabuddho_. ",
  "dn16:5.12.12": "This refers to the “eight individuals” who make up the “Saṅgha of disciples”, namely those who have achieved the four stages of awakening and those on the path. ",
  "dn16:5.12.17": "In contrast with Ajātasattu. ",
  "dn16:5.13.1": "Like Queen Subhaddā, wife of Mahāsudassana, at [dn17:2.8.7]() and [dn17:2.12.1](). | _Kapisīsa_ is door-jamb, not lintel. | For _vihāra_ (“building”) the commentary has “pavilion” (_maṇḍalamāla_), which may have been a temporary construction for the occasion (compare [mn92:4.6]()).

  "dn16:5.13.2": "At this point Ānanda was a stream-enterer. ",
  "dn16:5.14.2": "When admonishing Ānanda, the Buddha first gently but firmly restrains him, then gives words of support and encouragement. ",
  "dn16:5.14.5": "The phrase “undivided and limitless” (_advayena appamāṇena_) normally describes _kasiṇa_ meditation ([an10.25:1.3]()); here it is also found in the Sanskrit: _ānanda maitreṇa kāyakarmaṇā hitena sukhenādvayenāpramāṇena_. ",
  "dn16:5.14.6": "On the eve of the First Council—in about six months time—Ānanda devoted himself to meditation and achieved arahantship. ",
  "dn16:5.15.2": "The same is said regarding the chief disciples Sāriputta and Moggallāna at [sn47.14:2.4]() and regarding assemblies of deities at [dn20:4.3](). ",
  "dn16:5.15.6": "_Tittha_, literally “ford”, is a path to salvation, used as a term for a non-Buddhist “religion”. _Titthakara_ is a “religious founder” (literally “ford-maker”); _titthiya_ is a “monastic of (another) religion” (for example at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np22:1.2.5]()); _titthiyasāvaka_ is a “disciple of a monastic of (another) religion”. ",
  "dn16:5.16.1": "As at [an4.130:6.4](). Ānanda was in awe of the “incredible and amazing” qualities of the Buddha, and spoke of them often. Here, when Ānanda is at his most vulnerable, the Buddha turns the teaching around, pointing out that Ānanda is incredible and amazing too. ",
  "dn16:5.16.16": "This anticipates the story to follow. ",
  "dn16:5.17.4": "Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, and Kosambī were the capitals of Aṅga, Magadha, Kosala, and Vaccha respectively. Sāketa was the former capital of Kosala. Varanasi was formerly the capital of Kāsi, but at this time was contested by Kosala and Magadha, and had recently been won from Ajātasattu ([sn3.14](), [sn3.15]()). ",
  "dn16:5.18.1": "This story is also found in [dn17](). It seems that the Pali tradition extracted the story and greatly expanded it in an independent long discourse, whereas the Sanskrit tradition kept it at a more moderate length within the Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra itself. ",
  "dn16:5.18.2": "Kusāvatī features in the Kusajātaka ([ja531]()), where the ugly but wise prince Kusa, son of the legendary Okkāka, wins the hand of the radiant Pabhāvatī. The Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī, although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that _kusa_ grass, a prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage. ",
  "dn16:5.18.3": "A “league” (_yojana_) is usually estimated at between seven and twelve kilometers. By way of comparison, even at its greatest extent under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly legendary. ",
  "dn16:5.18.5": "According to [dn32](), Āḷakamandā was one of the many cities of Kuvera in Uttarakuru. ",
  "dn16:5.19.2": "Vāseṭṭha is a Vedic priestly clan. The Mallas adopted the name of their priest’s lineage, which was the normal custom for initiated _khattiyas_. Other examples in the Pali are Saccaka who is called Aggivessana ([mn35:4.2]()), and the Buddha and his family who are called Gotama. ",
  "dn16:5.19.6": "_Attadutiyo_ “with self as second” is also at [mn146:4.6]() where Nandaka visits the nuns. Sanskrit has _bhikṣuṇā paścācchramaṇena_ (“with a mendicant as accompanying ascetic”). It was apparently evening (the “wrong time”, _vikāla_), when it is inappropriate for a monk to be wandering the town alone. ",
  "dn16:5.20.1": "Evidently the Mallas, like the Vajjis, met frequently. ",
  "dn16:5.23.1": "This is the second Subhadda we have met in this discourse, the first being a deceased devotee of Ñātika ([dn16:2.6.13]()). The corrupt monk who, after the Buddha’s death, urges the rejection of the Vinaya rules is another person of the same name ([dn16:6.20.1]()). The Mahāsudassanasutta also features a Queen Subhaddā ([dn17:2.5.9]()). ",
  "dn16:5.26.4": "While some such as Mahāvīra the Ñātika ([mn14:17.2]()) and Pūraṇa Kassapa ([an9.38:2.1]()) claimed to have direct knowledge, others such as Ajita Kesakambala denied that such knowledge was possible ([dn2:23.2]()). ",

  "dn16:5.27.2": "While many aspects of the eightfold path are shared with others, some details may be missing (such as not-self or Nibbāna), while others are added (such as the belief in the efficacy of rituals, an eternal soul, or a creator god). ",

  "dn16:5.27.9": "This verse appears to be corrupt. The sense can be restored through two extra lines in the Sanskrit: “Ethics, immersion, conduct, and knowledge, and unification of mind have been developed by me, teacher of the references for the noble teaching.” | For _padesavattī_, the Sanskrit has _pradeśavaktā_, where _vaktā_ means “speaker” and _pradeśa_ has the sense “pointing out”. I think it means, “I am the one who taught the four great references (_mahāpadesa_)”. ",
  "dn16:5.30.8": "The commentary says this line was added at the Council. ",
  "dn16:6.1.5": "This is similar to the idea of the Four Great references, and sets the scene for the First Council at which the teachings were recited. | _Paññatto_ here means “pointed out” rather than “laid down”, as can be seen from [dn9:33.21](), where the same phrase refers to the four noble truths. ",
  "dn16:6.2.1": "_Āvuso_ is from the root _āyu_ (“age”) and thus has a respectful sense and does not mean “friend” as it is often translated. Like _bhante_, it is an indeclinable vocative of address that may be used with or without the name (see eg. [mn5:31.2]()). ",
  "dn16:6.2.3": "I render _bhante_ as “sir” when it stands alone and “honorable” when it prefixes a name. | Unlike _bhante_, _āyasmā_ (“venerable”) is declinable, so it is used in parts of speech other than direct address. It is from the same root as _āvuso_ but with a slightly more respectful tone, perhaps because it sounds more Sanskritic. ",
  "dn16:6.3.1": "These are not defined here, and the senior monks at the First Council were unable to agree on them ([pli-tv-kd21:1.9.3]()). Nonetheless, the Pali Vinaya consistently labels the Pācittiya rules as “lesser” (_khuddaka_; [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc92:2.2.22](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96:2.2.22](), [pli-tv-pvr1.1:219.3]()), which would make the Pātidesanīyas “minor” (_anukhuddaka_). The Sekhiya rules are also “minor”, but they were not at this point reckoned among the training rules for recitation. ",
  "dn16:6.4.1": "“Divine punishment” is _brahmadaṇḍa_. Channa features often in the Vinaya as a monk who refuses correction and acts disrespectfully. The Sangha had already imposed an act of “ejection” (_ukkhepanīyakamma_) on him due to his persistent bad behavior, but that was still not enough ([pli-tv-kd1:25.1.1]()). The _brahmadaṇḍa_ was imposed at the First Council ([pli-tv-kd1:1.12.1]()), upon which Channa finally saw the error of his ways. _Brahmadaṇḍa_ is encountered in a different sense at [dn3:1.23.21]().

  "dn16:6.4.4": "_Vattabba_ in such contexts means “advise, correct” rather than more generally “speak to”. Thus the _brahmadaṇḍa_ is not the “silent treatment”. ",

It is probably because of the latter two conflicts that Viḍūḍabha—Pasenadi’s son and the newly crowned king of Kosala—did not send an emissary to the funeral. By sparking conflicts with former allies the Sakyans and Mallas, Viḍūḍabha undid the successes of his father and fatally weakened the Kosalan Empire.
