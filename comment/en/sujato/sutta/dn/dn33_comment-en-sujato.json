  "dn33:1.1.2": "This discourse picks up from [dn29:17.1](), where the Buddha urges that the Sangha should gather and recite the Dhamma for the long lasting of the dispensation. There he lists the 37 factors of awakening, a standard early collation of practice-oriented teachings that are primarily collected in the Mahāvagga of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. This discourse is a late one, and appears to be an initial attempt to compile a more thorough list of the Buddha’s teachings. The Sarvāstivāda version of the same discourse formed the basis of one of their seven Abhidhamma books, the Sangītiparyāya. ",
