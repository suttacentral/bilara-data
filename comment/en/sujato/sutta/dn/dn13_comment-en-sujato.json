  "dn13:4.2": "It is not clear how this fits with Pokkharasāti’s conversion. Perhaps this was earlier, or perhaps he was simply teaching the Buddha‘s path. _Brahmasahabyatā_ does not mean “union with Brahmā” but rather “rebirth as one of the members of Brahma’s retinue” (see eg. [an5.34:9.4]()). ",
  "dn13:5.2": "It seems we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. ",
  "dn13:10.2": "Identified in Jayatilleke’s *Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge*, p. 480. Their texts are respectively: Śatapathabrāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad); Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa; Chāndogyabrāhmaṇa; and Bahvṛcabrāhmaṇa (incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki). I use the variant _bavhadija_ since it is closest to the Sanskrit _bahvṛca_. ",

  "dn13:36.2": "I wonder if this is a satire on the idea of _upaniṣad_ (“sitting near”); even as they affirm their commitment to their texts, they drift apart (_visāra_) into separate schools and ideologies. ",

  "dn13:78.2": "This is rejoicing and celebrating in the success of others or oneself. ",
  "dn13:78.3": "Equanimity is not indifference, which is why it emerges only at the end. It is literally “close watching” without interfering but standing ready when needed. ",
  "dn13:80.3": "",
  "dn13:81.10": "Here the entire concluding section of the Gradual Training dealing with wisdom is omitted, as the aim is limited to teaching rebirth with Brahmā to Brahmanical laypeople, rather than teaching liberation.
