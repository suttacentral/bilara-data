After being restored as an aristocrat, he and his family would still be referred to by that name. Thus the Sakyans’ _purohita_ must have been of the Gotama lineage.

  "dn14:2.22.5": "_Saṅkhāra_ in early Buddhism has three main doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is “conditioned phenomena”, which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [dn16:6.10.10](), [dn17:2.16.1](), and [dn34:1.8.59](). This essentially means “everything except Nibbana”. (2) Sometimes it is a physical or mental “process” or “activity” as at [dn18:24.1](), where it refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of meditation. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it has the sense of “morally potent volitions or choices” and is a synonym for _cetanā_ (“intention”). It is defined as good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([dn33:1.10.77]()), the latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth _jhāna_ and above. In this sense it is the moral “choices” for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new rebirth. ",
  "dn14:2.22.6": "The radical thesis of the Buddha’s teaching is the idea that consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [dn11](). ",
  "dn14:2.22.7": "This indicates the attainment of arahantship, the complete release from all attachments leading to rebirth. ",
  "dn14:3.1.1": "No longer a bodhisatta, he is now called a Buddha for the first time. ",
  "dn14:3.1.2": "In early Buddhism, the idea of teaching the Dhamma only arose after awakening. ",
  "dn14:3.1.4": "A similar account is told of Gotama Buddha at [sn6.1:1.4](), [mn26:19.2](), and [mn85:43.2](). ",
  "dn14:3.1.5": "Here “clinging” is _ālaya_, from a root meaning “to stick”. ",
  "dn14:3.1.6": "“Specific conditionality” (_ idappaccayatā_) refers to the fact that dependent origination traces the specific conditions for other specific things: this conditions that. It is not a general principle of universal conditionality (“everything is interconnected”). ",
  "dn14:3.1.7": "“Stilling of all activities” (_sabbasaṅkhārasamatho_) is the cessation of all conditioned energies or phenomena. | “Attachments” here is _upadhi_, the things of the world to which we cling and which bolster our complacency. ",
  "dn14:3.1.8": "The commentary is careful to specify that the Buddha means physical exhaustion only. ",
  "dn14:3.2.1": "For the source of this verse, “not supernaturally inspired” (_anacchariyā_) rejects the Vedic “channeling” of scripture from the Divinity, while “not learned before in the past” (_pubbe assutapubbā_), echoing the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta ([sn56.11:5.1]()), rejects the oral tradition. ",
  "dn14:3.2.9": "“Shrouded” is _āvuṭā_, which is from the same root as _asaṁvutā_ in [dn14:1.17.5]() above, as well as _nīvaraṇa_ (“hindrance”). All these terms ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra (“the constrictor”) who wraps the world in darkness. ",
  "dn14:3.2.10": "Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”. ",
  "dn14:3.2.11": "In the accounts of Gotama’s life this is specified as Brahmā Sahampati. This whole passage is a moment of high cosmic solemnity and drama. ",
  "dn14:3.3.2": "The Buddha teaches on the invitation of the highest divinity. This sets a precedent for Buddhists to refrain from proselytizing, but rather teach by invitation. These passages are still recited in some places to invite a teaching. ",
  "dn14:3.3.4": "_Aññātāro_ is an agent noun in plural, literally “understanders”. ",
  "dn14:3.6.1": "Previously he simply reflected to himself, now he uses his psychic abilities to ascertain people’s spiritual potential. ",
  "dn14:3.6.2": "_Indriya_ (“faculty”) is an abstract noun from _indra_, the name of the potent Vedic god of war. In the Vedas, Indra manifests his _indriya_ by drinking soma. The drug enables him to release his full potential and power; originally this probably referred to drinking an amphetamine-like substance before battle. Here we see that it means something like “spiritual potential” which is unleashed by the practice of the eightfold path. ",
  "dn14:3.7.14": "_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith. Pali commonly uses a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense. ",
  "dn14:3.8.5": "In the account of Gotama, he first thinks to teach his former colleagues under whom he practiced the formless attainments. Here we see the start of a tendency in the legends of past Buddhas to erase the education among other spiritual teachers before awakening. Note that these two, who will become Vipassī’s chief disciples, are leading _khattiya_ and brahmin sons of the royal household. Khaṇḍa was Vipassī’s brother, and the priest’s son was virtually family. ",
  "dn14:3.9.1": "_Khema_ (“sanctuary”) originally meant “oasis”. It is common name for lakes and nature parks in the Jātakas. ",
  "dn14:3.9.2": "There is a clear distinction between such managed “parks” and wilderness regions (_arañña_). ",
  "dn14:3.13.1": "In the early period, there was no distinction between “going forth” (_pabbajjā_) and “ordination” (_upasampadā_). They refer to two sides of the same coin: leaving the home life and entering the ascetic life. Ordination was originally granted with the simple call, “Come mendicant!” (_ehi bhikkhu_). ",
  "dn14:3.13.4": "Thus they became arahants, realizing the same truth that Vipassī had. ",
  "dn14:3.22.4": "As at [Kd 1:11.1.4](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#11.1.4) and [sn4.5:2.3](). One of the Buddha’s first acts is to empower his students. ",
  "dn14:3.22.9": "In the Vinaya of the current Buddha, the recitation occurs every fortnight on the _uposatha_ (“sabbath”), and it includes only the mendicants resident in a specific monastery. Here they gathered from all over India. ",
  "dn14:3.27.1": "“India” is _jambudīpa_, the “rose-apple continent”. The number 84,000 does not seem excessive, as the Chinese pilgrims recorded many thousands of monasteries throughout India. In modern Thailand there are around 40,000 monasteries. ",
  "dn14:3.28.1": "The verses that follow form the climax of the whole discourse. They are known as the Ovāda Pātimokkha, the “monastic code for exhortation”. It seems that they were recited on the _uposatha_ before the introduction of the list of rules that is also called _patimokkha_. Most of the extant Vinayas include these verses in the _pātimokkha_ texts, the Pali being a notable exception. ",
  "dn14:3.28.2": "The Buddha redefines _tapas_ from painful mortification to gentle acceptance. ",
  "dn14:3.28.3": "These verses speak of “Buddhas” in plural. ",
  "dn14:3.28.6": "These famous lines serve as a succinct summary of the entire Buddhist path. ",
  "dn14:3.28.7": "“Embrace” is _upasampadā_, to “enter into”. It is the same word used for taking ordination as well as entering _jhāna_. ",
  "dn14:3.28.8": "Through meditation. ",
  "dn14:3.28.9": "The _buddhasāsana_ (“instruction of the Buddha” or “dispensation of the Buddha”) is the normal word used by Buddhists to refer to their own religion. ",
  "dn14:3.28.11": "Here “monastic code” means the principles outlined in these verses. They are spelled out in more detail in the Gradual Training ([dn2](), etc.), and ultimately in the detailed legal code of the Vinayapiṭaka. ",
  "dn14:3.28.14": "The “higher mind” is the four _jhānas_ ([an3.90:3.2]()). ",
  "dn14:3.29.1": "The Buddha now returns to the present life. Ukkaṭṭhā is the home of Pokkharasāti ([dn3:2.13.1]()) and the site of the astonishing and cosmically significant discourses [mn1]() and [mn49](). ",
  "dn14:3.29.3": "Only non-returners are born in the pure abodes (_suddhāvāsā_), from where they realize full awakening. ",
  "dn14:3.29.6": "“Order of gods” is _devanikāya_. I use “deity” to distinguish _devatā_ from _deva_ but there is no substantial difference. ",
  "dn14:3.29.18": "This is a list of the major events in any Buddha biography. ",
  "dn14:3.29.19": "The lifespan in such a realm can be many hundreds of eons. ",
  "dn14:3.29.20": "These are absent in the Pali text at this point, but they are mentioned below, and the commentary says they should be included here. ",
  "dn14:3.33.3": "This is the detailed answer to the question asked by the mendicants at [dn14:1.13.6](). "
