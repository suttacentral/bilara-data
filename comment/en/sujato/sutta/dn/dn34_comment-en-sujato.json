The scheme is more rigorous; items listed according to a specific pattern, then the same pattern is amplified one by one. The constraints of this scheme mean that, while almost all the items listed here are found elsewhere, they are mostly not known by the name used here. This sutta seems a little later than [dn33](), but such conclusions should be drawn cautiously; in at least one detail, the absence of the _asura_ realm from the “lost opportunities”, the passage here is earlier.
