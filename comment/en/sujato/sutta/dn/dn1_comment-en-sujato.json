But in context I take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vassa</i> simply as “rain” and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vossa</i> as equivalent to Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vyavasya</i> in the sense of making a settlement for land.

  "dn1:1.28.1": "One meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhamma</i> is “principle” in the sense of a natural law as well as a moral value. Here begins the famous exposition of the sixty-two views.

  "dn1:1.30.1": "In such contexts, the “self” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>attā</i>) is a postulated metaphysical entity rather than a simple psychological sense of personal identity. The nature of this “self” or “soul” was endlessly debated.

The “cosmos” is the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>loka</i>, otherwise translated as “world”.

  "dn1:1.31.1": "The practice of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i> has never been regarded as uniquely Buddhist.

  "dn1:1.31.5": "The eternal “self” is contrasted with the ephemeral lives of beings. The famous word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsara</i> is often understood as a “cycle” of rebirths, but the meaning is, rather, to “wander on” or “transmigrate”. ",
  "dn1:1.31.9": "Their meditative experience revealed a process of transient and changing lives, yet from that they infer that there must be an eternal self. ",
  "dn1:1.32.3": "This differs only in the length of time, which is now up to ten eons. A single eon (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kappa</i>) lasts longer than it would take to wear away a huge mountain by stroking it with a cloth once a century <a href='/sn15.5/en/sujato'>SN 15.5</a>, while the number of eons is greater than the sands in the Ganges river <a href='/sn15.8/en/sujato'>SN 15.8</a>. The vast time periods envisaged in early Buddhist texts are comparable with those of modern cosmology in physics. ",
  "dn1:1.34.2": "These theorists used a process of logic to arrive at the same conclusion as the meditators. Different groups of ascetic philosophers emphasized contemplation or rational inquiry as the means to the truth. The Buddha acknowledged that both are useful but limited because, as here, they can sometimes lead to mistaken conclusions. ",
  "dn1:1.35.2": "I have my doubts about this phrase. Everywhere else, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ito bahiddhā</i> means “outside of the Buddhist community”, not “outside of the cases just considered”. Still, the commentary and the Chinese parallel at T 21 agree on this sense. ",
  "dn1:1.36.2": "A “view” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>diṭṭhi</i>) is a relatively fixed framework for understanding the world; a “theory”. The “grounds for views” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>diṭṭhiṭṭhānā</i>) are the bases from which the views are derived. In this case these are the meditative experiences or the logical reasoning. ",
  "dn1:1.36.3": "The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>parāmasati</i> means “to take hold” and is often used in the sense “to misapprehend”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nibbuti</i> is the verb form of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i>, which derives from the metaphor of “extinguishing” a flame. ",
  "dn1:1.36.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Yathābhūtaṁ</i> is often translated as “as it really is”, while I usually render it simply as “truly”.

Such direct vision of the truth is an attribute of the stream-enterer, who has realized the first of the four stages of awakening, in contrast with those on the path who still rely on faith or inference (<a href='/sn25.1/en/sujato'>SN 25.1</a>). Here it refers to the understanding of feelings from a fivefold perspective. Feelings underlie intellectual theories and arguments, which serve to sate cravings and fears. ",
  "dn1:1.37.1": "The truth is extremely hard to see, but it is possible. The Buddha has done it. ",
  "dn1:2.1.1": "Despite being views of the “self and the cosmos”, the main focus in the next four views is the self. ",
  "dn1:2.2.1": "This is the end of an eon. It might be compared with what the physicists call the “big crunch”. ",
  "dn1:2.2.2": "The human and similar realms are destroyed in the conflagration at the end of the universe, but sentient beings are sustained by the power of their past kamma. The “realm of streaming radiance” is a Brahmā heaven corresponding to the second <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>. ",
  "dn1:2.3.1": "This might be compared with the “big bang” of a cyclic universe. ",
  "dn1:2.3.2": "The realms into which beings are reborn exist interdependently with the beings themselves. The different dimensions correspond with different kinds of kamma. ",

  "dn1:2.6.5": "Again, their meditation experience is genuine, but what they infer from it goes beyond the facts. ",
  "dn1:2.6.8": "The surviving forms of Indic religion (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) typically hold that all creatures ultimately share the same nature and hence can find liberation. Here we see this was not always the case, for these theorists believed that there are inherently different orders of beings in the cosmos. This is not due to their conduct but to the circumstances of their creation. ",
  "dn1:2.7.2": "Note that mindfulness (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i>) is not held to be a specifically Buddhist virtue. Here it refers to a sense of moral compass and self-awareness, rather than a meditation practice. ",
  "dn1:2.9.5": "Here the difference in beings is attributed not to the circumstances of their creation but to their behavior. It seems that in this view heaven is lost forever. ",
  "dn1:2.10.2": "The parallel between <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manopadosika</i> (“malevolent”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khiddapadosika</i> (“depraved by play”) suggests a rendering “depraved in mind” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>manopadosika</i>.

  "dn1:2.18.2": "In each of the two previous sets of four views, the views themselseves were the same, only the means of knowing them differed. Here the views themselves differ. The differences take the form of a tetralemma: A, not-A, both A and not-A, neither A nor not-A. This pattern is commonly found in early Buddhism. The final two items are not meant to be obscure or mysterious, but to express genuine possibilities that cannot be captured by a simple duality. ",

  "dn1:2.20.3": "The text doesn’t specify what this is, but it might include the view that the ideas “finite” and “infinite” are inadequate to describe the universe.

Thus there is no other world, because all worlds are this world, but it is also not the case that there is nothing after death. ",
  "dn1:2.27.9": "This is beings such as the gods or various ghosts and spirits, which are not born organically. ",

  "dn1:2.27.18": "A sage ceases to exist at the time of death. From a Buddhist point of view, this is incoherent since it assumes the underlying attachment to a “self”, which the Realized One has done away with. ",

  "dn1:2.37.1": "This section introduces more tetralemmas. Many of the views describe the self in terms of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ",
  "dn1:2.38.3": "Usually a self is conceived of as percipient, so that the subject experiences a continuity. The term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aroga</i> (“well”) implies that the self survives in a healthy and undamaged form. A naive belief in heavenly rebirth would fall under this view. ",
  "dn1:3.2.1": "Here the self has a physical dimension but no perception. This might include rebirth as a plant or inanimate object. ",
  "dn1:3.5.1": "Buddhism acknowledges a formless realm of neither perception nor non-perception, which is attained through advanced meditation. ",
  "dn1:3.9.1": "These theorists assert the true existence of a being, thus falling into the fallacy of identity view. For the Buddha, the words “being” or a “self” describe an ongoing process that is conditioned and impermanent, and do not correspond to a genuine metaphysical reality. The distinction between contingent, empirical reality and metaphysical, absolute existence is essential to understanding Buddhism. ",
  "dn1:3.10.2": "This is the materialist view, which accepts only the coarse physical realm. This view is common today, but was also well known in the Buddha’s time. ",
  "dn1:3.11.2": "The theorist accepts multiple selves. As self theories evolve, they typically move from more coarse materialist theories towards more subtle conceptions. Sometimes the former view is rejected as being false. Sometimes, as here, the former view is seen not as false, but as incomplete and shallow. ",
  "dn1:3.11.4": "“Form” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>) includes not just the physical realm of the elements, but various kinds of subtle form (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhumarūpa</i>). These include the energetic or mind-made bodies of beings in various dimensions. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Rūpa</i>  ultimately refers to the appearance or manifestation of physical properties, and can even include the perception of colors, lights, and shapes in the mind. Here the bodies of the divine beings are not very distant from our own, as they still consume solid food. This probably refers to various nature deities or entities that were believed to consume the food offered to them by humans. ",
  "dn1:3.11.7": "Whereas the eternalists believe that their heavenly rebirth will last forever, annihilationists believe that even heaven is limited, and it ends in final annihilation. ",
  "dn1:3.12.4": "This is a more subtle kind of divine rebirth, no longer dependent on physical food. The subtle body still takes on a humanoid form, however, appearing complete in all its limbs. It includes realms produced through the practice of the four <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānas</i>. ",

  "dn1:3.13.7": "This phrase appears incongruous as formless beings do not have a body. However the Chinese parallel at DA 21 does not mention <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> here, so it is likely to have arisen as an error in transmission where an earlier phrase was mistakenly copied. ",

The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paritassita</i> (“anxiety”) conveys both fear and desire, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vipphandita</i> (“evasiveness”) captures how attachment to theorizing serves as an avoidance strategy. ",
  "dn1:3.45.1": "The analysis is introducing more elements of dependent origination. The famous twelve links say that contact is the condition for feeling, which in turn causes craving. ",
  "dn1:3.70.1": "The text repeats all, but I abbreviate for legibility. In the oral tradition, extensive repetitions serve to reinforce the learning and ensure reliability of transmission. More subtly, they also help deepen understanding and contemplation. After reciting the extensive and complex treatment of the sixty-two views, the reciter takes the time to go over them again and again, letting them settle and consolidate. True learning takes time. ",
  "dn1:3.71.12": "Finally the process of dependent origination, which has been foreshadowed little by little, is brought to its ultimate conclusion. It still does not include the full twelve factors, but the process beginning with ignorance is implied throughout. ",
  "dn1:3.72.2": "They cannot see a way past attachment so long as they theorize in terms of an existing self. ",
  "dn1:3.72.3": "The title is explained with a vivid simile. The Buddha was a master of observation, and constantly drew from everyday experience to illustrate his teachings. The metaphor works on a surface level to illustrate how theorists are trapped. But it also conveys something deeper, a sense of pathos and empathy with the helpless creatures who have no idea why they suffer. ",
  "dn1:3.73.1": "The Buddha is not his body, which is merely the remnant of past kamma. The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhavanetti</i> (“conduit to rebirth”) invokes a channel that leads to a future life. ",
  "dn1:3.73.4": "This metaphor is found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.36, where it refers to the separation of the self from the body at death. ",
  "dn1:3.74.3": "It is not uncommon to find multiple names for the same sutta, and here we see this practice originated with the Buddha himself. When is referred to by name at <a href='/sn41.3/en/sujato#2.4'>SN 41.3:2.4</a> and <a href='/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.8.8'>Pli Tv Kd 21:1.8.8</a>, however, it is always called the Brahmajāla. ",
  "dn1:3.74.6": "This is a sign of an especially momentous teaching. "
