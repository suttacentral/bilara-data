  "dn1:1.1.5": "While the disagreement of student and teacher signifies their confusion, it also represents the diversity of views within the brahmanical caste and the openness with which a student could disagree with their teacher. ",
  "dn1:1.2.1": "Ambalaṭṭhikā means “place of mango saplings”. It was a rest-house set up by the king of Rājagaha about a day’s journey from the capital. It must have been sizable. ",
  "dn1:1.3.1": "_Saṅkhiyadhamma_ is a unique term. The commentary glosses it as _kathādhamma_, following which it has been translated as “conversation” or “trend of conversation”. But _saṅkhā_ means “appraisal, assessment, evaluation, measuring, calculating”, and here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties assess or judge the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha.

  "dn1:1.10.3": "From [mn66:6.4]() and [mn70:4.8]() we can see that “at night” means after dark, while “at the wrong time” means in the afternoon. More explicitly, these are the “wrong time at night” and the “wrong time in the day”, in which case they are both the “wrong time”. ",

  "dn1:1.13.2": "_Sobhanaka_ (“beauty pageant”) is explained by the commentary as the movement (or “sprinkling”) of dancers, or their beautification and painting. The PTS reading _sobha-nagarakaṁ_, supported by an unrelated reference to a _gandhabba_ city of that name, is spurious. | _Caṇḍālaṁ vaṁsaṁ dhovanaṁ_ should be a compound, as shown by the prose to [ja498](), where it is a performance by corpse-workers (_caṇḍāla_) in Ujjenī. _Vaṁsa_ is the bamboo used by _caṇḍāla_ acrobats ([sn47.19]()). _Dhovana_ is referred by the commentary to [an10.107](), where it is a southern ceremony accompanied by drink and dance. The commentaries to AN and DN say it was the ritual washing of the bones of the buried dead after the decomposition of the flesh. Such “second funeral” rites have been observed world-wide. From the Jātaka it appears that the tradition had declined to a mere display for passers-by, perhaps featuring naked tribal girls. | _Uyodhika_ is sometimes said to be “sham fights”, but at [an10.30]() it is not a sham.

  "dn1:1.14.2": "“Checkers” (_aṭṭhapada_) was presumably the ancestor of the Gupta period _caturaṅga_ and hence modern chess. | _Yathāvajja_ is explained in the commentary as “mimicking deformities”, but I cannot find support elsewhere in Pali or Sanskrit for _vajja_ in this sense. More likely it refers to musical instruments (Sanskrit _vādya_). ",
  "dn1:1.17.1": "_Tiracchānakathā_ literally means “animal talk”. The Pali word for animal, _tiracchāna_ has the sense of “moving horizontally”, and “low talk” is that which does not elevate. ",

  "dn1:1.21.1": "This section focuses on practices that are wrong livelihood for a mendicant, though not for lay people. The Vinaya explains “low lore” as whatever is non-Buddhist or useless ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc49]()), while the commentary says it leads not to emancipation but to heaven. ",
  "dn1:1.21.2": "Reading _khattavijjā_ (“political science”) per variant as _khettavijjā_ (“geomancy”). | _Sara_ in _saraparitta_ means “sound” not “arrow”; compare with _sarabhañña_ “chanting”. | _Migacakka_ is explained in the commentary, supported by the astrological text Bṛhatsaṁhitā, as interpretation of the cries and behaviors of wild animals. Here the suffix _-cakka_ refers to the field of study. See also [mil5.3.7:6.1]() _sācakkaṁ migacakkaṁ antaracakkaṁ_ (“divining omens from dogs, wild animals, and the directions around”), terms which are also found at Bṛhatsaṁhitā 2. ",
  "dn1:1.22.2": "The commentary oddly has “earrings or house-gables” for _kaṇṇika_ (“eared one”), but it must be “rabbit”, for which see _sasakaṇṇikā_ at [ja535:76](). ",
  "dn1:1.24.2": "Despite this, astrology is commonly practiced today among Buddhist mendicants. | _(Up)pathagamana_ can hardly mean that the sun, moon, and stars will “go astray”. Rather, _patha_ here has the sense of “range”, so it means “come within range”, which describes an astrological conjunction. | For “fiery sky” (_disāḍāha_) as an ill omen, see _diśāṁ dāhe_ at Manusmṛti 4.115. ",
  "dn1:1.25.2": "“Cosmology” (_lokāyata_) in early Buddhist texts is not, as it later became known, the heterodox school of materialism. Rather, it was a branch of worldly knowledge within regular Vedic studies concerned with the nature and extent of the world and how this may be known ([an9.38](), [sn12.48]()). ",
  "dn1:1.26.2": "The commentary has _saṅkiraṇa_/_vikiraṇa_ as “saving and spending” (cp. [snp1.6:23.1]()), but it seems unlikely. _Vikiraṇa_ means “scattering” food or sand, while Sanskrit  _vikira_ is the ritual scattering of rice. Given the context, I think it refers to the custom of scattering rice at a wedding. | For _viruddhagabbhakaraṇa_, _viruddha_ means “obstructed”. The commentary here, in general agreement with the Niddesa on _gabbhakaraṇa_ at [snp4.14](), explains as giving treatments for the survival of the fetus. | I omit _hanujappana_ as it is absent from the commentary and seems to have just arisen by confusion. ",
  "dn1:1.27.2": "Medicine is right livelihood, but a mendicant should not make a living from it. They may treat fellow mendicants, family members, or those close to the monastery. | _Santikamma_ is the Sanskrit _śāntikakarman_, a rite for averting evil. | For _vassakamma_ and _vossakamma_, the commentary has “fertile and infertile men” (_vassoti puriso, vossoti paṇḍako_), taking “rain” as a metaphor for semen. Such usages do have precedent elsewhere. But in context I take _vassa_ simply as “rain” and _vossa_ as equivalent to Sanskrit _vyavasya_ in the sense of making a settlement for land. | I take _paṭimokkho_ in the sense of “binding” (cf. _paṭimukka_ at [mn38:41.11]() etc.) rather than the commentary’s “release” (from the effects of caustic medicines; cf. [tha-ap25:5.4]()). ",
  "dn1:1.28.1": "One meaning of _dhamma_ is “principle” in the sense of a natural law as well as a moral value. | Here begins the famous exposition of the sixty-two views. The subtlety of the analysis lies in how, rather than refuting the details of the views, the Buddha traces them all back to their fundamental psychology. ",
  "dn1:1.30.1": "In such contexts, the “self” (_attā_) is a postulated metaphysical entity rather than a simple psychological sense of personal identity. The nature of this “self” or “soul” was endlessly debated. The Buddha rejected all theories of a “self”, and elsewhere it is said that “identity view” underlies all sixty-two views of the Brahmajāla ([sn41.3:4.13]()). | The “cosmos” is the _loka_, otherwise translated as “world”. This sometimes refers to the simple physical realm, sometimes to the world of experience, or else, as here, the vast universe as conceived in ancient Indian thought. ",
  "dn1:1.31.1": "“Immersion” (_samādhi_) is deep meditative stillness. The word conveys the sense of “gathered”, “collected”, with a secondary sense of “ignited”, “illuminated”. The practice of _samādhi_ (or _jhāna_, “absorption”) has never been regarded as uniquely Buddhist. However, right meditation begins with right view. Since these meditators begin with wrong view, their _samādhi_ is “wrong” because it merely reinforces their error. ",
  "dn1:1.31.2": "The recollection of past lives is specific, detailed, and confident as it is based on the clear mind of deep immersion. ",
  "dn1:1.31.4": "This is the Upaniṣadic view of the eternal _ātman_ that is the immanent soul of the world or cosmos, _loka_. Elsewhere in the suttas such theorists assert that the self and the cosmos are identical ([sn24.3:1.3](): _so attā so loko_). ",
  "dn1:1.31.5": "The eternal “self” is contrasted with the ephemeral lives of beings. | The famous word _saṁsara_ is often understood as a “cycle” of rebirths, but the meaning is, rather, to “wander on” or “transmigrate”. | For the phrase _sassatisamaṁ_ (“lasting forever and ever”), compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.10.1: “He reaches that world free of sorrow and snow, where he lives forever and ever” (_sa lokam āgacchaty aśokam ahimam | tasmin vasati śāśvatīḥ samāḥ_). ",
  "dn1:1.31.9": "Their meditative experience revealed a process of transient and changing lives, yet from that they infer that there must be an eternal self. ",
  "dn1:1.32.3": "This differs only in the length of time, which is now up to ten eons. A single eon (_kappa_) lasts longer than it would take to wear away a huge mountain by stroking it with a cloth once a century [sn15.5](), while the number of eons is greater than the sands in the Ganges river [sn15.8](). The vast time periods envisaged in early Buddhist texts are comparable with those of modern cosmology in physics. ",
  "dn1:1.34.2": "These theorists used a process of logic to arrive at the same conclusion as the meditators. Different groups of ascetic philosophers emphasized contemplation or rational inquiry as the means to the truth. The Buddha acknowledged that both are useful but limited because, as here, they can sometimes lead to mistaken conclusions. ",
  "dn1:1.35.2": "I have my doubts about this phrase. Everywhere else, _ito bahiddhā_ means “outside of the Buddhist community”, not “outside of the cases just considered”. Still, the commentary and the Chinese parallel at T 21 agree on this sense. ",
  "dn1:1.36.2": "A “view” (_diṭṭhi_) is a relatively fixed framework for understanding the world; a “theory”. The “grounds for views” (_diṭṭhiṭṭhānāni_) are the bases from which the views are derived. In this case these are the meditative experiences or the logical reasoning. ",
  "dn1:1.36.3": "The word _parāmasati_ means “to take hold” and is often used in the sense “to misapprehend”. ",
  "dn1:1.36.4": "_Yathābhūtaṁ_ is often translated as “as it really is”, while I usually render it simply as “truly”. It often has a technical sense of seeing “how things came to be (_bhuta_)” as a process of conditionality ([sn12.31:7.1]()). Such direct vision of the truth is an attribute of the stream-enterer, who has realized the first of the four stages of awakening, in contrast with those on the path who still rely on faith or inference ([sn25.1]()). Here it refers to the understanding of feelings from a fivefold perspective. Feelings underlie intellectual theories and arguments, which serve to sate cravings and fears. ",
  "dn1:1.37.2": "Long texts are sometimes marked by their “recitation sections” (_bhāṇavāra_), which was the length that would be recited in one session. ",
  "dn1:2.1.1": "Despite being views of the “self and the cosmos”, the main focus in the next four views is the self. ",
  "dn1:2.2.1": "This is the end of an eon. It might be compared with what the physicists call the “big crunch”. ",
  "dn1:2.2.2": "The human and similar realms are destroyed in the conflagration at the end of the universe, but sentient beings are sustained by the power of their past kamma. | The “realm of streaming radiance” is a Brahmā heaven corresponding to the second _jhāna_. ",
  "dn1:2.2.3": "“Mind-made” (_manomaya_) beings are spontaneously born due to past kamma, not by sex. | “Rapture” (_pīti_) is a joyous emotional response to pleasure, usually a spiritual sense of elevation or uplift in meditation. ",
  "dn1:2.3.1": "This might be compared with the “big bang” of a cyclic universe. ",
  "dn1:2.3.2": "The realms into which beings are reborn exist interdependently with the beings themselves. The different dimensions correspond with different kinds of kamma. ",
  "dn1:2.3.3": "That is, they pass from a world corresponding to the second _jhāna_ to one corresponding to the first _jhāna_. ",
  "dn1:2.4.1": "This passage echoes the creation myth in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4. At 1.4.2, the self-created Divinity feels fearful and alone, and at 1.4.3 and 1.4.17 wishes for a partner. From a Buddhist point of view, this simply shows how even God is trapped by emotional attachments in the cycle of transmigration. ",
  "dn1:2.4.3": "These beings are reborn according to their own kamma, and it is just a coincidence that they appear after the first being made their wish. ",
  "dn1:2.5.2": "His first words _ahamasmi brahmā_ (“I am Brahmā”) are equivalent to _aham brahmāsmīti_ at 1.4.10. See too _so’hamasmīti_ (“I am that”) at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.1, which parallels the Pali _eso’hamasmi_ at [mn28:6.8]() etc. ",
  "dn1:2.5.3": "At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.5 the Divinity thinks, “I created all this”. ",
  "dn1:2.5.7": "The other creatures appeared after his wish, not because of it. God confuses correlation with causation, a mistake perpetuated by no small number of his followers. ",
  "dn1:2.5.12": "At Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.9–10 the created humans also think first about the Divinity who preceded them, from whose knowledge of self all was created. ",
  "dn1:2.6.5": "Again, their meditation experience is genuine, but what they infer from it goes beyond the facts. ",
  "dn1:2.6.8": "The surviving forms of Indic religion (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) typically hold that all creatures ultimately share the same nature and hence can find liberation. Here we see this was not always the case, for these theorists believed that there are inherently different orders of beings in the cosmos. This is not due to their conduct but to the circumstances of their creation. ",
  "dn1:2.7.2": "Delightful as the life of the gods is, even they are supposed to retain a sense of moderation ([mn37:11.2]()), a lesson forgotten by those “depraved by play” (_khiḍḍāpadosikā_). | Note that mindfulness (_sati_) is not held to be a specifically Buddhist virtue. Here it refers to a sense of moral compass and self-awareness, rather than a meditation practice. ",
  "dn1:2.9.5": "Here the difference in beings is attributed not to the circumstances of their creation but to their behavior. ",
  "dn1:2.10.2": "The parallel between _manopadosika_ (“malevolent”) and _khiddapadosika_ (“depraved by play”) suggests a rendering “depraved in mind” for _manopadosika_. However, elsewhere in the suttas _manopadosa_ consistently means “malicious intent” ([mn56:13.15](), [mn93:18.30](), [dn26:20.3](). Also see _mano padūseyya_ at [mn21:20.1]() and [mn28:9.6](). Thus the contrast is between greed and hate. | Here, as usual, _mano_ and _citta_ are synonyms for “mind”. ",
  "dn1:2.13.4": "This is mind-body dualism, the idea that the mind is made of a fundamentally different stuff than the body. ",
  "dn1:2.16.1": "Here we move from views that conceive of both the self and the cosmos together to those that focus only on the physical extent of the cosmos. It is not  clear why these are classified as “views of the past”. ",
  "dn1:2.17.1": "Once again the view is inferred from meditation, showing that meditative experience was regarded by some as revealing genuine truths about the physical realm. ",
  "dn1:2.17.5": "The nature of their meditation is assumed to be the nature of the world itself. ",
  "dn1:2.18.2": "In each of the two previous sets of four views, the views themselves were the same, only the means of knowing them differed. Here the views themselves differ. The differences take the form of a tetralemma: A, not-A, both A and not-A, neither A nor not-A. This pattern is commonly found in early Buddhism, as well as Indian thought more generally. The final two items are not meant to be obscure or mysterious, but to express genuine possibilities that cannot be captured by a simple duality. ",
  "dn1:2.18.6": "It is common today to say that one’s own experience is valid for oneself. Clearly that is not how these philosophers thought. ",
  "dn1:2.19.2": "They perceive the universe as spread out like a disc. One might call it a “discworld”. ",
  "dn1:2.20.3": "The text doesn’t specify what this is, but it might include the view that the ideas “finite” and “infinite” are inadequate to describe the universe. Consider a universe expanding at the speed of light. At any point in time it is not infinite, but as it is impossible to reach its end it is not finite either. ",
  "dn1:2.23.1": "_Vikkhepa_ is “ﬂip-flopping”. | _Amarā_ is explained in the commentary as either “undying” or “eel-like”. However, _amarā_ in the sense of “eel” is found only in the commentary to this term so is probably spurious. ",

  "dn1:2.27.9": "This is beings such as the gods or various ghosts and spirits, which are not born organically. ",
  "dn1:2.27.10": "This denies the existence of such beings. Not everyone in ancient India believed in the various orders of beings. ",
  "dn1:2.27.11": "The belief that beings are both spontaneously born and organically born. Perhaps this denies that such a distinction can be made clearly, because both kinds of birth take place within the same order of beings. ",

  "dn1:2.37.1": "This section introduces more tetralemmas. Many of the views describe the self in terms of the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ",
  "dn1:2.38.3": "Usually a self is conceived of as percipient, so that the subject experiences a continuity. | The term _aroga_ (“free of disease”) is explained by the commentary as “permanent” (_nicca_), drawing on the root sense of the word, “unbroken”. However, _aroga_ is always used in the sense “free of disease, well, healthy” (eg. [mn97:2.4]()), and this applies to the Brahmanical tradition as well as the Buddhist. Chandogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2 says that one who sees (the self) does not see death, they have no disease or pain. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.12 similarly says that one who sees the self will not suffer in the wake of the body, which Śaṅkāra explains, “Struggling with desires for himself, for his son, for his wife, and so on, he is born and dies again and again, and is diseased when his body is diseased.” ",

For the Buddha, the words “being” or a “self” describe an ongoing process that is conditioned and impermanent, and do not correspond to a genuine metaphysical reality. The distinction between contingent, empirical reality and metaphysical, absolute existence is essential to understanding early Buddhism. ",
  "dn1:3.10.2": "This is the materialist view, which accepts only the coarse physical realm. This view is common today, but was also well known in the Buddha’s time. | The “four principal states” are earth, water, fire, and air, i.e. the states of matter: solid, liquid, plasma, and gas. ",
  "dn1:3.11.2": "The theorist accepts multiple selves. As self theories evolve, they typically move from more coarse materialist theories towards more subtle conceptions. Sometimes the former view is rejected as being false. Sometimes, as here, the former view is seen not as false, but as incomplete and shallow. ",
  "dn1:3.11.4": "“Form” (_rūpa_) includes not just the physical realm of the elements, but various kinds of subtle form (_sukhumarūpa_). These include the energetic or mind-made bodies of beings in various dimensions. _Rūpa_  ultimately refers to the appearance or manifestation of physical properties, and can even include the perception of colors, lights, and shapes in the mind. Here the bodies of the divine beings are not very distant from our own, as they still consume solid food. This probably refers to various nature deities or entities that were believed to consume the food offered to them by humans. ",
  "dn1:3.11.7": "Whereas the eternalists believe that their heavenly rebirth will last forever, annihilationists believe that even heaven is limited, and it ends in final annihilation. ",
  "dn1:3.12.4": "This is a more subtle kind of divine rebirth, no longer dependent on physical food. The subtle body still takes on a humanoid form, however, appearing complete in all its limbs. It includes realms produced through the practice of the four _jhānas_. | _Sabbaṅga_ has the sense “whole and healthy of limb” (Rig Veda 10.161.5c, Atharva Veda 8.2.8c, 11.3.32 ff.). One is reborn with “whole body” (_sarvatanu_, Atharva Veda 5.6.11c, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.1.8.60, 12.8.3.31). | _Paccaṅga_ means “minor limb”, for example the fingers or internal organs. ",
  "dn1:3.13.4": "Such a rebirth has left even the subtle body behind, becoming sheer consciousness. | The word _āyatana_ is from a root meaning “expanse”. It is prominently used in this context, where it refers to a realm or “dimension” of rebirth, and in the analysis of sense experience, where it refers to a “field” of sense experience. ",
  "dn1:3.13.7": "This phrase appears incongruous as formless beings do not have a body. However the Chinese parallel at DA 21 does not mention _kāya_ here, so it is likely to have arisen as an error in transmission where an earlier phrase was mistakenly copied. ",
  "dn1:3.16.4": "The extension of the normal description of this state with the phrase “this is peaceful, this is sublime” is found only here and at [an10.99:35.1](). ",
  "dn1:3.19.1": "These five theories argue for the extinguishment of suffering through the experience of pleasure in the present life. The Buddha taught extinguishment (_nibbāna_) in this very life, but not “of an existing being” (_sato sattassa_) or “self” (_attā_). The Buddha denied that there is such a thing, pointing out that we are a stream of ever-changing conditions, fueled by desire and attachment, and liable to suffering. With the end of craving there is no fuel to sustain the stream, so suffering comes to an end. | It is unclear why these views of the “present life” (_diṭṭhadhamma_) are classified under views of the future; see [mn102:2.8](). ",
  "dn1:3.20.2": "The hedonist. ",
  "dn1:3.21.5": "Here we see the philosophical reasoning that prompts the evolution of more refined conceptions of self. ",
  "dn1:3.21.6": "The “absorptions” (_jhāna_) are central to Buddhist meditation. The Buddha did say that they can be considered “extinguishment in the present life” in a qualified sense ([an9.51]()). As we have seen above, however, if they are undertaken with wrong view, the experience itself will tend to reinforce the attachment to a self. ",
  "dn1:3.22.3": "The theorist has an experience of a deeper state of meditation, so they know that the first _jhāna_ cannot be the ultimate. ",
  "dn1:3.22.5": "_Jhānas_ are subtle states of refined consciousness in which nothing is coarse when compared to ordinary consciousness. Within each state, however, certain mental factors are coarse relative to others. A meditator proceeds through the _jhānas_ with the successive stilling of the relatively coarser factors in each state. ",
  "dn1:3.24.5": "_Ābhoga_ (“partaking”) is unique in the early texts in this sense. The commentary says that after emerging from _jhāna_, one repeatedly partakes and attends to that bliss (for _ābhoga_ with _manasikāra_, see [mil5.1.1:8.3]()). Compare Patañjalī’s commentary on Yogasūtra 1.17: “_vitarka_ is the gross (_sthula_) partaking in the mental object, _vicāra_ is subtle”. ",
  "dn1:3.25.2": "It is not clear why the still more subtle states of the formless attainments are not included here. ",
  "dn1:3.30.2": "Even the views of annihilation or extinguishment lead to rebirth, contrary to the beliefs of those who hold them. ",
  "dn1:3.32.1": "Here the Buddha brings to the fore the notion of feelings which has been briefly mentioned throughout the text. Views are not objective descriptions of the world, but responses to our innermost needs. The word _paritassita_ (“anxiety”) conveys both fear and desire, while _vipphandita_ (“evasiveness”) captures how attachment to theorizing serves as an avoidance strategy. ",
  "dn1:3.45.1": "The analysis is introducing more elements of dependent origination. The famous twelve links say that contact is the condition for feeling, which in turn causes craving. ",
  "dn1:3.70.1": "The text repeats all, but I abbreviate for legibility. In the oral tradition, extensive repetitions serve to reinforce the learning and ensure reliability of transmission. More subtly, they also help deepen understanding and contemplation. After reciting the extensive and complex treatment of the sixty-two views, the reciter takes the time to go over them again and again, letting them settle and consolidate. True learning takes time, but the repetitions that are reflective and reassuring in recitation become irksome and ponderous in reading. ",
  "dn1:3.71.12": "Finally the process of dependent origination, which has been foreshadowed little by little, is brought to its ultimate conclusion. It still does not include the full twelve factors, but the process beginning with ignorance is implied throughout. ",
  "dn1:3.72.1": "“Contact” (_phassa_) is the conjunction of the sense stimulus, the sense organ, and the associated consciousness. ",
  "dn1:3.72.2": "They cannot see a way past attachment so long as they theorize in terms of an existing self. ",
  "dn1:3.72.3": "The title is explained with a vivid simile. The Buddha was a master of observation, and constantly drew from everyday experience to illustrate his teachings. The metaphor works on a surface level to illustrate how theorists are trapped. But it also conveys something deeper, a sense of pathos and empathy with the helpless creatures who have no idea why they suffer. ",
  "dn1:3.73.1": "The Buddha is not his body, which is merely the remnant of past kamma. The phrase _bhavanetti_ (“conduit to rebirth”) invokes a channel that leads to a future life. ",
  "dn1:3.73.4": "This metaphor is found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.36, where it refers to the separation of the self from the body at death. ",
  "dn1:3.74.3": "It is not uncommon to find multiple names for the same sutta, and here we see this practice originated with the Buddha himself. When is referred to by name at [sn41.3:2.4]() and [pli-tv-kd1:1.8.8](), however, it is always called the Brahmajāla. ",
  "dn1:3.74.6": " "
