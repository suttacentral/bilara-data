  "dn1:1.1.1": "Tradition holds that these were the words spoken by Ānanda when reciting the Suttapiṭaka at the First Council following the Buddha’s death. In fact it is a tag signifying that the text has been passed down through oral tradition and the speaker was not present at the events. ",
  "dn1:1.1.2": "By convention, suttas do not specify the date, which means we have very little internal chronology for when they were spoken. It’s about fifteen kilometers from modern Rajgir to Nalanda. “Mendicant” is a literal translation of _bhikkhu_, one who goes for alms. ",
  "dn1:1.1.3": "The word translated as “student” is _antevāsi_, a live-in pupil of a brahmanical master. ",
  "dn1:1.1.4": "This is the Triple Gem that makes up the Buddhist religion. They are not known by that term in the early texts. ",
  "dn1:1.1.5": "While the disagreement of student and teacher signifies their confusion, it also represents the diversity of views within the brahmanical caste and the openness with which a student could disagree with their teacher. ",
  "dn1:1.2.1": "This was a rest-house set up by the king of Rājagaha about a day’s journey from the capital. It must have been sizable. ",
  "dn1:1.3.1": "_Saṅkhiyadhamma_ is a unique term. The commentary glosses as _kathādhamma_. Bodhi and Ṭhānissaro effectively just have it as “conversation”. Rhys Davids followed by Walshe have something like “trend of conversation”. But _saṅkhya_ means “evaluation, measuring, calculating”, and here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties evaluate the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha. ",
  "dn1:1.3.2": "_Adhimutti_ is something that has been decided, a conviction or belief. ",
  "dn1:1.4.1": "This would have been an open air pavilion in the rest-house. By convention, when a teacher or other respected person is to sit, a sitting mat is spread out or made ready for them. ",
  "dn1:1.4.2": "The very first words of the Buddha in the Suttapiṭaka: he asks to hear what others are saying. ",
  "dn1:1.4.3": "Here and in similar passages the Pali repeats all and I abbreviate. ",
  "dn1:1.5.1": "The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific. They “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. judging others). Cp. [mn22](), where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral _hoti_, while for the mendicants it uses _karaṇīya_, as here. ",
  "dn1:1.5.2": "Complaining about others does not hurt them, only the one who gets upset. ",
  "dn1:1.5.3": "Equanimity is a prerequisite for evaluating facts. ",
  "dn1:1.7.1": "Ethics (or morality or virtue, _sīla_) is important in the world, but it pales in comparison with the higher dimensions of the Buddha’s path. ",
  "dn1:1.7.2": "Here the Buddha lays out in detail the ethical conduct for mendicant followers. ",
  "dn1:1.8.1": "The first and most important precept. It is not just the negative injunction to avoid killing, but also the positive injunction to have compassion for all creatures. ",
  "dn1:1.9.1": "Just as the precept of not killing implies the positive injunction to live with compassion, the precept against not lying implies the positive injunction to speak the truth.",
  "dn1:1.10.1": "While Buddhism generally does not consider plant life to be sentient, it is still valuable as part of the ecosystem that supports all life.",
  "dn1:1.10.3": "This is interpreted today as eating only in the morning.",
  "dn1:1.10.4": "This and the next three precepts encourage peace of mind for meditation.",
  "dn1:1.10.7": "The Pali is literally “gold and silver”, but the corresponding Vinaya rule makes it clear that any form of money is included.",
  "dn1:1.10.8": "Mendicants should not store up food and cook it themselves.",
  "dn1:1.10.16": "These items are discussed in detail below.",
  "dn1:1.10.17": "",
  "dn1:1.11.2": "That these are not five “kinds of seeds” but five kinds of “plants grown from seeds” is clear from the Vinaya and its commentary ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc11]():  _Bhūtagāmo nāma pañca bījajātāni_). ",
  "dn1:1.12.1": "For storing up food as a sign of decline, see [dn27:17.5]().",
  "dn1:1.13.2": "_Uyodhika_ is sometimes said to be “sham fights”, but at [an10.30](), it is not a sham. And the definition at [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc50]() says _yattha sampahāro dissati_ “where strife is seen”. ",
  "dn1:1.14.1": "While gambling isn’t mentioned explicitly here, _jūtappamādaṭṭhānānuyoga_ is treated in DN 31 exclusively as gambling, so it seems that is implied. ",
  "dn1:1.14.2": "See <a href='https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/some-brief-notes-on-games/5329'>Some Brief Notes on Games</a>. ",
  "dn1:1.20.1": "This includes trading monastery offerings for profit.",
  "dn1:1.21.1": "Translations of _tiracchāna_ in such contexts (debased, low, etc.) are often harsher than the old explanations. The Vinaya [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc49](Bi Pc 49) explains it as whatever is non-Buddhist or useless, while the commentary says it leads not to emancipation but to heaven.",
  "dn1:1.21.2": "Reading _khattavijjā_ per variant as _khettavijjā_. _Sara_ in _saraparitta_ means “sound” not “arrow”. Compare with _sarabhañña_ “chanting”.",
  "dn1:1.22.2": "The commentary oddly has “earrings or house-gables” for _kaṇṇika_ (“bigears”), but it must be “rabbit”, for which see _sasakaṇṇikā_ at [ja535:76]().",
  "dn1:1.24.2": "_(Up)pathagamana_ can hardly mean that the sun, moon, and stars will “go astray”. Rather, _patha_ here has the sense of “range”, so it means “come within range”, which describes an astrological conjunction.",
  "dn1:1.26.2": "Commentary has _saṅkiraṇa/vikiraṇa_ as “saving and spending” (cp. [snp1.6:23.1]()), but it seems unlikely. _Vikiraṇa_ means “scattering” food or sand, while Sanskrit  _vikira_ is the ritual scattering of rice. Given the context, I think it refers to the Indian custom of scattering rice at a wedding. For _viruddhagabbhakaraṇa_, _viruddha_ means “obstructed”. The commentary here, in general agreement with the Niddesa on _gabbhakaraṇa_ at [snp4.14](), explains as giving treatments for the survival of the fetus. I omit _hanujappana_ as it is absent from the commentary and seems to have just arisen by confusion.",
  "dn1:1.27.2": "_Santikamma_ is the Sanskrit _śāntikakarman_, a rite of for averting evil. For _vassakamma_ and _vossakamma_, commentary has “fertile and infertile men” (_vassoti puriso, vossoti paṇḍako_), taking “rain” as a metaphor for “semen” which fertilizes. Such usages do have precedent elsewhere. But in context I take _vassa_ simply as “rain” and _vossa_ as equivalent to Sanskrit _vyavasya_ in the sense of making a settlement for land.",
  "dn1:1.35.2": "I have my doubts about this phrase: in every other occurrence, ito bahiddha means “outside of the Buddhist community”. Still, comm and the Chinese text at T21 agree on this sense. ",
  "dn1:2.5.7": "Correlation and causation! ",
  "dn1:2.10.2": "The parallel with khiddapadosika rather confuses the issue, suggesting a rendering “depraved in mind” here. However elsewhere in the suttas, manopadosa consistently means “malicious intent”, MN 56, MN 93, also see mano padūseyya at MN 21 and MN 28. Thus the contrast here would seem to be greed vs hate. Also note DN 26, “tesaṁ sattānaṁ aññamaññamhi tibbo āghāto paccupaṭṭhito bhavissati tibbo byāpādo tibbo manopadoso tibbaṁ vadhakacittaṁ.”"
