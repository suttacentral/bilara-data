  "dn24:1.1.6": "The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#19.3'>MN 81:19.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#1.3'>MN 140:1.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#11.2'>SN 1.50:11.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#12.2'>SN 2.24:12.2</a>). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators. ",
  "dn24:1.2.10": "Sunakkhatta’s dismal spiritual career began when he met the Buddha in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn105/en/sujato'>MN 105</a>. In <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn6/en/sujato#5.3'>DN 6:5.3</a> we learn that, after being ordained three years, he spoke of his limited success in meditation. The current sutta and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn12/en/sujato'>MN 12</a> deal with Sunakkhatta’s bitter criticisms of the Buddha shortly after his disrobal. ",

Moreover, a noble disciple is unable to dedicate themselves to another teacher (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an1.276/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 1.276:1.1</a>). But when the Buddha called candidates to go forth, he spoke of practice rather than personal devotion: “Come, monk. The Teaching is well-proclaimed. Practice the spiritual life to make a complete end of suffering.” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#6.32.3'>Kd 1:6.32.3</a>) ",

Thus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>korakhattiya</i> is not a personal name, but rather “the aristocrat of Kuru”. The name of the city <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uttarakā</i> means “northern”, and Kuru is indeed northern. Occam’s razor would urge us not to assume the existence of an otherwise unknown tribe on such a dubious term when it can be explained more parsimoniously as an ancient misspelling of Kuru.
