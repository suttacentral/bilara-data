  "dn25:1.3": "The Buddha refers to the events of this sutta at [dn8:23.2](), but apart from that Nigrodha (“Banyan”) appears to be unknown. A “wanderer” may or may not be Brahmanical, but in DN 8 Nigrodha is called _tapabrahmacārī_, which suggests he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. | The commentary describes _udumbarikā_ (“Fig”) as _devī_ (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. She too does not seem to appear elsewhere. ",

  "dn25:5.5": "“One-eyed cow” is _gokāṇā_. ",
  "dn25:5.10": "_Orodheyyāma_ normally means “enclose, trap” like ox in a pen ([an6.60:3.1]()), but here it is glossed in the commentary as _vinandheyyāma_ (“twist around”). ",
  "dn25:7.9": "This discourse highlights the Buddha’s method of engaging with people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win converts, but to help people be free of suffering. ",
  "dn25:7.16": "“About the disgust of sin” renders _adhijegucche_. The basic sense is “disgust”. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of fervent mortification (_tapas_) to burn out the corruption. ",
  "dn25:7.17": "The phrase _kathaṁ santā_ is unique; it echoes _evaṁ sante_ below. ",

  "dn25:16.8": "_Bhāvitamāsīsati_ is unique. In this and similar contexts, the Pali tradition says _bhāvita_ (“reward”, normally “developed”) is the “five sense pleasures” as they see it (_bhāvitaṃ nāma tesaṃ saññāya pañca kāmaguṇā_; cp. [mn56]() commentary: _ettha ca bhāvitanti pañcakāmaguṇā_), explaining that this is a usage of the sectarians (Saddanīti ch. 4: _titthiyasamaye pana bhāvitoti kāmaguṇo vuccati_). ",
