A “wanderer” may or may not be Brahmanical, but in DN 8 Nigrodha is called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tapabrahmacārī</i>, which suggests he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. | The commentary describes <i lang='pi' translate='no'>udumbarikā</i> (“Fig”) as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>devī</i> (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”.

  "dn25:7.9": "This discourse highlights the Buddha’s method of engaging with people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win converts, but to help people be free of suffering. ",
  "dn25:7.16": "“Higher disgust of sin” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhijegucche</i>. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of fervent mortification (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tapas</i>) to burn out the corruption. ",
