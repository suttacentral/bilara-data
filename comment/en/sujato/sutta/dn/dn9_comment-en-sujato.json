The commentary explains that the brahmins, Jains, and others would assemble there to “debate their beliefs” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samayaṁ pavadanti</i>). Evidently the monastery grounds had accommodation for many ascetics of different beliefs, but only “one hall” where they would gather for debate. We hear many times of such debates, but here we catch a glimpse of a place that was set up to facilitate them.

  "dn9:2.2": "According to the commentary, when he approached the vicinity of the city gate, he decided to check the position of the sun and noticed that it was too early to enter. The commentary and sub-commentary explain that it only sounds like the Buddha was in doubt, for Buddhas deliberate before deciding on a course of action. ",
  "dn9:2.3": "This can be understood as answering the criticism voiced in <a href='/dn8/en/sujato#22.2'>DN 8:22.2</a>, that the Buddha was afraid to speak in an assembly. ",
  "dn9:3.1": "In contrast with the silence of the Buddha’s community at <a href='/dn2/en/sujato#10.7'>DN 2:10.7</a>. ",

  "dn9:6.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Abhisaññā</i> does not appear elsewhere. Here the prefix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhi-</i> means not “higher”, but rather “about, concerning”.

The commentary here says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhi-</i> is a mere particle, so it need not be translated. ",
  "dn9:6.5": "This discussion appears to have been directly sparked by the difficult passage in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13. The sage Yājñavalkya, teaching his wife Maitreyī, says that the true Self is a sheer mass of “consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vijñāna</i>, Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>), which is “great, endless, infinite reality”. After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁjñā</i>, Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>), a statement that bewilders even the wise Maitreyī. He explains that only in an apparent state of duality (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dvaitamiva</i>) do the separate functions of sense consciousness operate; when all is realized as the Self, how, he asks, can one know that owing to which all this is known? He is implicitly distinguishing between <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāna</i> as “infinite” (= <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vi-</i>) knowing and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i> as “constrained” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁ-</i>) knowing. Yājñavalkya says the separate Self emerges with these elements and vanishes with them (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>etebhyo bhūtebhyaḥ samutthāya tānyevānu vinaśyati</i>), but he does not explain how or why this happens, which is the question the theorists here attempt to address. ",
  "dn9:6.7": "Here perception is not identified with the “person” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>purisa</i>), but rather belongs to them (cf. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>etaṁ mama</i>, “this is mine”). In the discussion to follow, the Buddha only directly addresses this theory, while the remainder are included by inference. ",

The commentary fairly drips with contempt: “Allegedly, the Āthabbaṇa practitioners cast a spell, showing a creature’s head as if cut off, or their hand as if cut off, or as if dead. Then they show them back to normal; imagining so, they say, ‘From cessation they have arisen.’” ",

Here they appear as part of the gradual refinement of consciousness through the cessation of increasingly subtle perceptions. ",
  "dn9:14.2": "This is the vision of light that later came to be called a “sign” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nimitta</i>). In the first four <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānas</i> this persists as a “subtle” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) reflection or echo of the “substantial” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>olārika</i>) material basis of meditation, such as the breath or the parts of the body. Even though it is a purely mental phenomenon, it is still “form” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>) since it has physical properties like light or extension. ",
  "dn9:14.3": "The “light” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>obhāsa</i>) of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> grows from “limited” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paritta</i>) to “limitless” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>appamāṇa</i>, <a href='/mn128/en/sujato#29.1'>MN 128:29.1</a>).

  "dn9:17.4": "“Intend and choose” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ceteyyaṁ abhisaṅkhareyyaṁ</i> (1st singular optative). These synonyms are used in the sense of a subtle sense of will or intentionality that underlies such attainments (<a href='/mn52/en/sujato#14.3'>MN 52:14.3</a>) and which must be let go lest they generate rebirth (<a href='/mn140/en/sujato#22.10'>MN 140:22.10</a>).

  "dn9:18.3": "Taking the kernel of Yājñavalkya’s theory of the cessation of limited perception, the Buddha has expanded it in psychological and practical detail, while leaving out the metaphysical assumption of the Self. ",
  "dn9:18.4": "Poṭṭhapāda shows the Buddha that he has been paying attention. Notice how it is culturally assumed that it is possible to retain and repeat the exact content of the teaching. ",
  "dn9:19.4": "The meaning of this is not clear to me. It might mean that insight can be developed based on any of the stages of meditation, so for that person their peak of perception is different to another’s.

  "dn9:20.1": "Poṭṭhapāda’s distinction between “perception” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>) and “knowledge” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ñāṇa</i>) echoes Yājñavalkya’s distinction between “perception” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁjā</i>) and “consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vijñāna</i>, or in the repeated passage at 4.5.13, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>prajñāna</i>).

  "dn9:20.2": "Perception has been described in terms of the progress through more refined meditations (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i>). Only then does the “knowledge” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ñāṇa</i>) of insight arise. ",
  "dn9:20.4": "The term “specific condition” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>idappaccayā</i>) is well known from dependent origination (eg. <a href='/sn12.20/en/sujato#2.3'>SN 12.20:2.3</a>), where it applies to the general situation of ongoing existence in transmigration. When developing insight, a meditator takes their own meditation experience as their primary locus. This is then generalized to an understanding of the nature of conscious existence. ",
  "dn9:21.1": "This draws from the initial presentation of different theories of the person and perception (<a href='/dn9/en/sujato#6.4'>DN 9:6.4</a>). ",
  "dn9:21.2": "“Believe” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccesi</i>, literally “fall back on”. It implies that an idea is something one relies on or takes as fundamental. The Buddha wants to know where Poṭṭhapāda stands before exploring this topic. ",
  "dn9:21.3": "Despite his previous questions about perception and the self, Poṭṭhapāda takes his stand on a purely materialist view, identifying the “self” with the organic “substantial” body. ",
  "dn9:21.4": "Again, the Buddha does not rush to tell Poṭṭhapāda he is right or wrong, but rather draws out the implications of his statement. ",
  "dn9:21.6": "Here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tiṭṭhateva</i> is not “leaving aside”, but “remains”. Compare the similar construction at <a href='/mn107/en/sujato#13.1'>MN 107:13.1</a>. ",
  "dn9:22.1": "This is the “subtle” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) body, corresponding with the form experienced in the four jhānas.

  "dn9:23.1": "This identifies the self as that which is experienced in the formless attainments. Poṭṭhapāda is simply cycling through possible self theories without really thinking through the implications. ",
  "dn9:24.1": "Poṭṭhapāda can only attest a belief in various theories and still does not know how to assess them for himself. ",
  "dn9:24.3": "The text shifts from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>añña</i> “other” (eg. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññadiṭṭhikena</i>) to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññatra</i> (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññatr’āyogena</i>), which normally means “apart from”. Most authorities follow the commentary in taking <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aññatra</i> here in the sense of “other”. However I think the change of sense is deliberate; the Buddha is not discouraging them, merely informing them what it will take. ",

  "dn9:33.3": "This point seems to be lost on a number of modern commentators, who infer from passages such as the ten undeclared points that the Buddha refused to make any definitive declarations at all.

  "dn9:48.2": "Citta is asking an ontological question, assuming that these three states are existent realities of the self. ",
  "dn9:49.1": "The Buddha reframes the question as one of conventional description. He is describing states in which one might be reborn, not underlying ontologies. ",
  "dn9:49.8": "This anticipates one of the great philosophical debates of sectarian Buddhists which gave rise to the Sarvāstivāda, the school whose core doctrine was that “all exists (in the past, future, and present)”. The Buddha describes past, future, and present with the three grammatical tenses. ",
  "dn9:53.5": "This is a succinct expression of one of the key insights of the Buddha’s teaching. Words such as “self” have a conventional usage and in that context are perfectly fine. But what that “self” refers to is constantly changing, as it is reincarnated in different states. It is like a river which keeps the same name even though the water is always changing. If, driven by attachment, we assume there is a metaphysical reality underlying the conventional “self”, we step beyond what can be empirically verified. Note, however, that the Buddha is <em>not</em> asserting that there are two levels of truth, conventional and ultimate, a distinction not found in early Buddhism. ",

We can reconcile these two accounts by recognizing that the phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>acira</i> “not long after” is a conventional term, which might be several years. Thus the events of AN 6.60 occurred some time between his ordination and awakening. "
