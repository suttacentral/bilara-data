  "dn32:1.0": "I believe this is only place in whole canon that lists the _bhāṇavāra_ at the start. ",
  "dn32:3.2": "These verses lean heavily on the translation by Anandajoti, http://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Safeguard/03-Tatiyakabhanavaram.htm ",
  "dn32:4.29": "Comm: Kusalena samekkhasīti anavajjena nipuṇena vā sabbaññutaññāṇena mahājanaṁ olokesi. I think this line is harking back to the problem the yakkhas have; they think the Buddha is judging and condemning them. By “kusala” here i understand that he sees them both “clearly”, as in he recognizes their misdeeds, and “kindly” in the sense that rather than condemning them he shows them skillfull and kindly how to be better. ",
  "dn32:7.12": "This is a literal rendering of “Tuṇḍikīre”. Comm says “Tattha kira jotikapāsāṇā nāma honti” the kira indicating their uncertainty. MW suggests a relation with tandoori; but, while that is indeed an ancient word, it seems the root is to “mud”, so unlikely here. It’s possible, though, that the commentary, familiar with some variant on tandoori, took that as the explanation. Presumably it was a pot that looked like a parrot’s beak, or perhaps which cracked the rice like a parrot. But given the context we should not discount the possibility that it was meant literally. It would hardly be the most fantastic tale told of foreign lands. ",
  "dn32:7.13": "Cloven and uncloven was an important classification of animals in the dharmasastras, etc. ",
  "dn32:7.17": "I think and hope this means a rickshaw, not piggyback! ",
  "dn32:7.59": "_Kuḷīrakā_ appears to be the name of a crab-eating bird (_kuḷīra_). In honor of my native country, I name it after the kookaburra, which eats crabs and is renowned for its cry. ",
  "dn32:7.60": "In [ja547] we find _koṭṭhā pokkharasātakā_, where the _koṭṭha_ is evidently a woodpecker. _Satapatta_ can mean woodpecker or lotus (or crane or peacock), and perhaps there is an association here, the “hundred-leaved [bird] of the lotus pond”. "
