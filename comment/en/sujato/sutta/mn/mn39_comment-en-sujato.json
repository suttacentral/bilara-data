  "mn39:1.2": "Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*, this is not the same Assapura referred to in [ja422](), as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. ",
  "mn39:2.1": "",
  "mn39:2.2": "This sutta deals with the difference between outer perception and inner reality, addressing what we call “imposter syndrome”. The Buddha inspires students to aspire to the highest ideal through the practice of the Gradual Training so that they live up to their labels and claims. ",
  "mn39:4.2": "_Chiddavā_ (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (_acchidda_) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. [mn48:6.12]()). | _Saṁvuta_ (past participle of _saṁvara_) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of _ca_ split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. _Saṁvara_ appears in the sense of sense restraint below ([mn39:8.4]()). ",
  "mn39:14.1": "The similes for the hindrances and jhānas feature also in [dn2:69.1]() and [dn10:2.7.1](). ",
  "mn39:20.3": "",
  "mn39:22.1": "This series of epithets is also found at [an7.85]()–92, split over separate suttas, and with other terms and explanations in [snp3.6](). The explanations here rely on puns that are not really possible to reproduce in English. ",
  "mn39:23.1": "_Samaṇa_ (“ascetic”) is from a root meaning to exert or weary oneself, but here is explained as if related to _samita_ (“assuaged”, “calmed”). ",
  "mn39:23.2": "",
  "mn39:24.1": "The root sense of _brah-_ is to “amplify” or “empower”, but is explained as _bāhita_ (“banished”, “expelled”). ",
  "mn39:24.2": "",
  "mn39:25.1": "A _nhātaka_ (Sanskrit _snātaka_) is one who has performed the ritual ablutions on the completion of his studies. ",

  "mn39:25.3": "",
  "mn39:26.1": "The “knowledge” in _vedagū_ is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. Curiously, it is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. Perhaps it arose by contraction from _(tiṇṇaṁ) vedānaṁ pāragū_ (cf. Sanskrit _vedapāraga_). ",
  "mn39:27.1": "_Sottiya_ (“scholar”) is from the root “to hear” as is the more familiar Pali term “disciple” (_sāvaka_, literally “hearkener”). In Brahmanism _śrotrīya_ refers to one who is well versed in the Vedas. Here, however, it is connected with the root _su_ (“to flow”), as in one who has rinsed off or “scoured off” bad things. ",
  "mn39:28.1": "Both _ariya_ and _arahant_ are explained with the same word _āraka_, meaning “far from (defilements)”. The commentary gives _āraka_ in both cases, but explains _ariya_ as “slayer” and _arahant_ as “far from”. At [an7.91](), PTS has _arīhatattā_, “foe-slayer” for _ariya_ (BJT omits). This is a slightly better pun for _ariya_, although at _snp3.6:38.1_ _ariya_ is punned with _ālaya_ (“clinging”), which is better than both. Neither of the Chinese parallels (MA 182 at T i 725c4, EA 49.8 at T ii 802b4) mentions the _arahant_ and only MA 182 mentions the _ariya_. It seems likely the duplication is an early textual corruption due to an expansion of the text in Pali. However, given that the sense “far from” is more consistently attested for the _arahant_, and that _arīhatattā_ is a (marginally) better pun for _ariya_, I translate according to the commentary. "
