  "mn39:1.2": "Assapura, the “horse fort”, appears to be unknown apart from its mention here and the next sutta. Contra *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names*, this is not the same Assapura referred to in [ja422](), as that lay south of Ceti, far to the west. An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. ",
  "mn39:2.1": "",
  "mn39:2.2": "This sutta deals with the difference between outer perception and inner reality, addressing what we call “imposter syndrome”. The Buddha inspires students to aspire to the highest ideal through the practice of the Gradual Training so that they live up to their labels and claims. ",
  "mn39:4.2": "_Chiddavā_ (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (_acchidda_) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. [mn48:6.12]()). | _Saṁvuta_ (past participle of _saṁvara_) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of _ca_ split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. _Saṁvara_ appears in the sense of sense restraint below ([mn39:8.4]()). ",
  "mn39:8.4": "",
  "mn39:14.1": "The similes for the hindrances and jhānas feature also in [dn2:69.1]() and [dn10:2.7.1](). ",
  "mn39:15.3": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_). ",
  "mn39:15.4": "The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience. ",
  "mn39:16.3": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. ",
  "mn39:17.3": "The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. ",
  "mn39:18.3": "The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. ",
  "mn39:20.3": "",
  "mn39:22.1": "This series of epithets is also found at [an7.85]()–92, split over separate suttas, and with other terms and explanations in [snp3.6](). The explanations here rely on puns, the feel of which I have tried to echo in English. ",
  "mn39:23.1": "_Samaṇa_ (“ascetic”) is from a root meaning to exert or weary oneself, but here is explained as if related to _samita_ (“assuaged”, “calmed”). ",
  "mn39:23.2": "",
  "mn39:24.1": "The root sense of _brah-_ is to “amplify” or “empower”, but is explained as _bāhita_ (“banished”, “expelled”). This is a common play on words, eg. [ud1.4:4.1](), [dhp388:1](). ",
  "mn39:24.2": "",
  "mn39:25.1": "A _nhātaka_ (Sanskrit _snātaka_) is one who has performed the ritual ablutions on the completion of his studies. ",

  "mn39:25.3": "",
  "mn39:26.1": "The “knowledge” in _vedagū_ is the Vedas in Brahmanism and the three knowledges in Buddhism. Curiously, it is not an attested term in Brahmanical texts. Perhaps it arose by contraction from _(tiṇṇaṁ) vedānaṁ pāragū_ (cf. Sanskrit _vedapāraga_). ",
  "mn39:27.1": "_Sottiya_ (“scholar”) is from the root “to hear”, as is the more familiar Pali term _sāvaka_ (“disciple”, “student”, literally “hearkener”). In Brahmanism _śrotrīya_ refers to one who is well versed in the Vedas. Here, however, it is connected with the root _su_ (“to flow”), as in one who has “rinsed off” or “scoured off” bad things. ",
  "mn39:28.1": "Both _ariya_ and _arahant_ are explained with the same word _āraka_, meaning “far from (defilements)”. The commentary gives _āraka_ in both cases, but explains _ariya_ as “slayer” and _arahant_ as “far from”. At [an7.91](), PTS has _arīhatattā_, “foe-slayer” for _ariya_ (BJT omits, while at least one more variant is attested). This is a slightly better pun for _ariya_ than _āraka_, although at [snp3.6:38.1]() _ariya_ is punned with _ālaya_ (“clinging”), which is better than both. Where both MA 182 and the parallel to [mn40]() at MA 183 at T i 726c13 mention the _ariya_, the Indic pun underlying EA 49.8 seems to be that a _kṣatriya_ is so called because they “end” (Sanskit _kṣaya_) the defilements. Neither of the Chinese parallels (MA 182 at T i 725c4, EA 49.8 at T ii 802b4) mentions the _arahant_, suggesting it was added later, which would explain the duplication of _āraka_. However, given that “far from” is consistently attested for the _arahant_ in all editions and commentary; that “foe-slayer” is attested for _ariya_ in some texts and commentaries; and that _kṣatriya_ in the sense of “warrior” is loosely in the same semantic realm as “foe-slayer”, I translate accordingly. ",
  "mn39:29.1": "_Arahant_ (“perfected one”) has the root sense “worthy” and in Buddhism has the sense of one who has perfectly or “impeccably” removed all defilements. "
