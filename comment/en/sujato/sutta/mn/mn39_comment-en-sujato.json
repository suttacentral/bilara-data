An Aśvapura is mentioned in Jain legends, but there is nothing to link this with the Aṅgan town. | Aṅga lay to the east of Magadha on the Ganges, towards modern Bengal. ",

  "mn39:4.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Chiddavā</i> (“inconsistent”) is more literally “full of holes”. Its opposite (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>acchidda</i>) is one of the standard descriptors of “impeccable” precepts (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn48/en/sujato#6.12'>MN 48:6.12</a>). | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṁvuta</i> (past participle of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁvara</i>) can mean either “restrained” or “hidden, secretive”. The sense depends on the syntax; the two instances of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ca</i> split the listed items into three plus two, with the negative distributed over the last two items. This agrees with the commentary, which explains “secretive” as “concealing one’s faults”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṁvara</i> appears in the sense of sense restraint below (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn39/en/sujato#8.4'>MN 39:8.4</a>).

The commentary gives <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āraka</i> in both cases, but explains <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ariya</i> as “slayer” and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahant</i> as “far from”. At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.91/en/sujato'>AN 7.91</a>, PTS has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arīhatattā</i>, “foe-slayer” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ariya</i> (BJT omits, while at least one more variant is attested).

Neither of the Chinese parallels (MA 182 at T i 725c4, EA 49.8 at T ii 802b4) mentions the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahant</i>, suggesting it was added later, which would explain the duplication of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āraka</i>. However, given that “far from” is consistently attested for the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahant</i> in all editions and commentary; that “foe-slayer” is attested for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ariya</i> in some texts and commentaries; and that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kṣatriya</i> in the sense of “warrior” is loosely in the same semantic realm as “foe-slayer”, I translate accordingly.
