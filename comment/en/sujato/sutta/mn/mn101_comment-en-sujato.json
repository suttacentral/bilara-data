  "mn101:1.2": "Devadaha also appears in [sn22.2]() and [sn35.134](). The name is explained in the commentary as “royal lake”, taking _deva-_ as a term for kings, and _-daha_ as equivalent to the Sanskrit _hrada_, “lake”. However it is spelled _devadṛśa_ in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya ([San Mu Kd 17:6](https://suttacentral.net/san-mu-kd17/san/gbm#sc16)). _Dṛśa_ means “sight, appearance”, and thus occupies a completely different semantic space that “lake”. It is a Vedic term that commonly describes Agni’s fiery gleam (Rig Veda 3.17.4, 6.10.4, 7.1.1, etc.). This suggests a Pali derivation from √_ḍah_, “to burn”, recalling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.4.1.14, which allegorically depicts the spread of Aryan culture eastward as Agni “burning” (_dadāha_) the lands, i.e. introducing the civilized practice of Vedic fire worship. It became famous in later Buddhism as the birthplace of the sisters Māyā and Mahāpajāpatī of the Koliyan clan, the Buddha’s birth mother and foster mother. These details are not mentioned in early texts, however, where the town is said to be Sakyan rather than Koliyan. It is identified with Devdaha in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. ",
  "mn101:2.5": "The view that all experiences are caused by past kamma is consistently rejected in the suttas (eg. [an3.61:2.1](), [sn36.21]()). This is reflected in the later Theravada commentaries, which describe five interacting _niyāmas_, or systems of natural law: seasons (_utu_), genetics (_bīja_), moral or immoral deeds (_kamma_), mind (_citta_), and principles of the teaching (_dhamma_). Nonetheless, the view that all experiences are caused by kamma is extremely common among modern Buddhists, and is often heard even from learned scholars. This is a harmful misunderstanding, as it has led to discrimination against the poor and disabled in Buddhist countries. One point of confusion is that rebirth into a particular life is caused by kamma, so in that general sense, kamma is a necessary condition for having a life in which one can experience anything. But the feelings experienced in that life are caused by a variety of things, not necessarily by kamma. ",
  "mn101:15.3": "This is a difficult sentence, and different translators handle it in quite different ways. I take vipaccetha as second plural optative, intended as a rhetorical question. The sense, I think, plays on the common meaning of “ripen”, but in the sense “make something out of it that it isn’t”, i.e. (mis)construe. ",
  "mn101:18.1": "BB’s translation is based on Abhidhamma via comm, and is incorrect. ",
  "mn101:22.12": "PTS edition has the expected papa. ",
  "mn101:23.4": "BB takes viraga here in the sense of “fade away”, but it seems hard then to differentiate it from nijjinna. In addition, in the simile viraga is used in the sense of dispassion. Thus I think that is the sense here, too. "
