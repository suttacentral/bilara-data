At [mn21:7.4]() the Buddha reminisced about the days when he merely needed to mention it and monks would follow suit. | In the related story at [mn70:1.3](), the Buddha encouraged not eating at night, to which monks also objected, occasioning the laying down of a Vinaya rule ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37]()), although at least some of the monks later came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare ([mn66:6.4]()).

The idiom can be captured more literally at [dn3:2.6.2](); when King Pasenadi meets Pokkharasāti, he does not “grant him an audience face to face” (_tassa … sammukhībhāvampi na dadāti_) but only behind a curtain.
