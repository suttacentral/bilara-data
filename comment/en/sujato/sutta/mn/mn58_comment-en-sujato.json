In this sutta he appears as an acolyte of Mahāvīra, while in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn46.56/en/sujato'>SN 46.56</a> he asks the Buddha about Pūraṇa Kassapa. Apart from these details he is unknown in the early texts. Commentaries say he was the son of King Bimbisāra by one of his queens, Padumavatī of Ujjenī, making him half-brother to Ajātasattu. They also say that following Bimbisāra’s death, Abhaya went forth and spoke the verse at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.26/en/sujato'>Thag 1.26</a>. | Not to be confused with Abhaya the Licchavī of <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.74/en/sujato'>AN 3.74</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.196/en/sujato'>AN 4.196</a>; nor with the author of <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.98/en/sujato'>Thag 1.98</a>; nor is <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig2.8/en/sujato'>Thig 2.8</a> addressed to his mother, but that of the nun Abhayā (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig2.9/en/sujato'>Thig 2.9</a>).

An aspect of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anekantavāda</i> is the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>syadvada</i>, which frames all statements with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>syā</i>, “it may be”. This uses the optative tense to conditionally affirm or deny without making absolute statements. The same tense is employed here by Mahāvīra in order to trap the Buddha on the horns of a dilemma (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ubhatokoṭika</i>). Needless to say, this is not how he is presented in Jain texts. ",
