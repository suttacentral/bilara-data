The form of both suttas parallels Yājñavalkya’s reticence to answer Janaka.

Yājñavalkya answers that it is simply the sun. When pressed further, he admits it might be the moon, then fire, or even speech, for you can make it home in the dark when someone is calling. All these things—sun, moon, fire, speech—are worshipped in the Vedic tradition as external manifestations of divinity. He only reluctantly admits that a person’s true light is their Self, made of consciousness, the light in the heart. This is the same Self referred to above in the phrase, “whose nature is to desire only the self”. | The Vedantic commentator Śaṅkara, on a verse of the same chapter (4.3.7), discusses at length Buddhist objections to his doctrine.

  "mn128:15.3": "The key terms here are “perceive” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sañjānāma</i>), “light” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>obhāsa</i>), and “vision of forms” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dassanañca rūpānaṁ</i>).

  "mn128:23.3": "The opposite of the previous, here the mind subtly falls back from the meditation too far. They are not exactly drowsy, but the mind lacks the keenness to go deeper. In response, a meditator needs to apply the mind a little more strongly to the meditation. ",

This is a wholesome motivation, but at this point it can disturb the meditation. ",
  "mn128:25.3": "Diversity can arise through the activity of the senses, or through the variety of “forms” seen by the meditator. Either way, the mind must be settled to find true oneness. ",
  "mn128:26.6": "The “forms” seen in meditation can be enticing and fascinating, appearing as glimpses of other realms, impressions of the presence of beings, or images of past lives. If the meditator pays too much attention to them, they lose focus on the meditation itself. ",
  "mn128:28.9": "This shows how <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nimitta</i> has a causal sense. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Manasikāra</i> (“focus”) is typically used of paying attention to causes. ",
  "mn128:31.4": "This threefold presentation of the process of absorption focuses on <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vitakka</i> (“placing the mind”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicāra</i> (“keeping it connected”), looking closely at how they cease (see also <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.10.121'>DN 33:1.10.121</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato#1.4.7'>DN 34:1.4.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn43.3/en/sujato#1.2'>SN 43.3:1.2</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.63/en/sujato#3.1'>AN 8.63:3.1</a>). The standard <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> formula focuses more on the refinement of feelings, from which perspective the first two stages of immersion here fall under the “rapture and bliss born of seclusion”, while only the third qualifies as “rapture and bliss born of immersion”. Thus Analayo describes the two descriptions as “complementary perspectives on the same process of deepening concentration” (<em>Comparative Study</em>, vol. ii, pg. 739, note 263). "
