  "mn90:1.1": "The narrative of this sutta is entertainingly chaotic, with characters appearing and disappearing at random, many of whom are unknown or little-known elsewhere. This is a lifelike impression of how hard it is to maintain a rational dialogue among the comings and goings. Historically it gives a brief but telling character portrait of Viḍūḍabha, the ill-starred prince of Kosala. ",

  "mn90:3.1": "These sisters were apparently both married to the King and, like his chief queen Mallikā, were devoted to the Buddha. Somā is perhaps the devout laywoman mentioned at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.91-117/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 8.91–117:1.1</a>, but is probably not the bhikkhunī of the same name mentioned at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn5.2/en/sujato'>SN 5.2</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig3.8/en/sujato'>Thig 3.8</a>.

  "mn90:5.3": "The Buddha was well aware of the fact that people did, in fact, make such claims, as he discussed them several times (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato#21.1'>MN 76:21.1</a>). He just thought the claims were wrong. One unique detail of the phrasing here is that it is in future tense (also used below at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn90/en/sujato#8.5'>MN 90:8.5</a>). The implication seems to be that not only is it the case that no-one currently makes such claims, but that no-one ever will in the future. | Compare with other statements on omniscience at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.3'>MN 14:17.3</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn71/en/sujato#5.2'>MN 71:5.2</a>.

At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato#52.5'>MN 76:52.5</a> the Buddha discusses the related point of whether knowledge is continuous, illustrating it with a simile of an amputee. ",

  "mn90:13.2": "The sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi devā</i> (“do gods survive?”) is made clear by the following discussion.

In such cases the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> implies continued existence in a future life. We find a similar usage in Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.20, where Naciketa wonders what happens to a man after he dies, as “some say he survives, while others say he does not survive” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>astīty eke nāyam astīti caike</i>).

  "mn90:13.3": "Questions with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> (“exists”, “survives”) about the self and rebirth are routinely met indirectly. Here the Buddha asks for clarification; at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn44.10/en/sujato#1.3'>SN 44.10:1.3</a> he avoids answering; at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato#42.5'>MN 100:42.5</a> he answers in an oblique fashion. The reason for this seems to be that the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> conveys the metaphysical implication of “eternal existence”. The king clarifies that he wants to know what happens when a god passes away, showing that he is asking about rebirth rather than eternal existence. ",
  "mn90:13.6": "This builds on the discussion with Pasenadi in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn88/en/sujato#10.6'>MN 88:10.6</a>, where “hurtful” or “afflicted” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sabyābajjha</i>) behavior leads to suffering, elsewhere described as rebirth in a “hurtful” realm (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn57/en/sujato#8.2'>MN 57:8.2</a>).
