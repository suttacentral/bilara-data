  "mn90:1.1": "The narrative of this sutta is entertainingly chaotic, with characters appearing and disappearing at random, many of whom are unknown or little-known elsewhere. This is a lifelike impression of how hard it is to maintain a rational dialogue among the comings and goings. Historically it gives a brief but telling character portrait of Viḍūḍabha, the ill-starred prince of Kosala. ",
  "mn90:1.2": "Ujuññā was a Kosalan town at which discussed asceticism with the naked ascetic Kassapa in [dn8](). | “Deer parks” were nature reservations where the animals were safe from hunters. ",
  "mn90:3.1": "These sisters were apparently both married to the King and, like his chief queen Mallikā, were devoted to the Buddha. Somā is perhaps the devout laywoman mentioned at [an8.91-117:1.1](), but is probably not the bhikkhunī of the same name mentioned at [sn5.2]() and [thig3.8](). Sakulā likewise is probably not the same person as the bhikkhunī mentioned in [thig5.7]() and [an1.242:1.1](). ",
  "mn90:5.3": "The Buddha was well aware of the fact that people did, in fact, make such claims, as he discussed them several times (eg. [mn76:21.1]()). He just thought the claims were wrong. One unique detail of the phrasing here is that it is in future tense (also used below at [mn90:8.5]()). The implication seems to be that not only is it the case that no-one currently makes such claims, but that no-one ever will in the future. | Compare with other statements on omniscience at [mn14:17.3]() and [mn71:5.2](). ",
  "mn90:6.1": "The King’s son and heir, whose disastrous reign heralded the destruction of the Sakyans and the collapse of the Kosalan empire. ",
  "mn90:6.3": "_Ākāsa_ here is the Pali form of Sanskrit _āgastya_, the clan descending from the Vedic seer Agastya. ",
  "mn90:8.5": "Consciousness is conditioned, so any instance of knowing depends on a particular stimulus. At [mn76:52.5]() the Buddha discusses the related point of whether knowledge is continuous, illustrating it with a simile of an amputee. ",
  "mn90:9.8": "The Buddha acknowledges the social distinctions between the classes. ",
  "mn90:12.14": "_Nimmathita_ refers to the process whereby a flame is produced by “churning” with a fire-drill. See Rig Veda 3.23.1a, 3.29.12a, 6.48.5, 8.48.6a, etc. ",
  "mn90:13.2": "The sense of _atthi devā_ (“do gods survive?”) is made clear by the following discussion. Compare _atthi attā_ (“the self survives”) at [sn44.10:1.3]() and [mn2:8.2]() in the same sense. In such cases the verb _atthi_ implies continued existence in a future life. We find a similar usage in Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.20, where Naciketa wonders what happens to a man after he dies, as “some say he survives, while others say he does not survive” (_astīty eke nāyam astīti caike_). ",
  "mn90:13.3": "Questions with _atthi_ (“exists”, “survives”) about the self and rebirth are routinely met indirectly. Here the Buddha asks for clarification; at [sn44.10:1.3]() he avoids answering; at [mn100:42.5]() he answers in an oblique fashion. The reason for this seems to be that the verb _atthi_ conveys the metaphysical implication of “eternal existence”. The king clarifies that he wants to know what happens when a god passes away, showing that he is asking about rebirth rather than eternal existence. ",
  "mn90:13.6": "This builds on the discussion with Pasenadi in [mn88:10.6](), where “hurtful” or “afflicted” (_sabyābajjha_) behavior leads to suffering, elsewhere described as rebirth in a “hurtful” realm (eg. [mn57:8.2]()). ",
  "mn90:14.2": "In a few words we learn a lot about how Viḍūḍabha sees himself: he is an afflicted god. ",
  "mn90:14.11": "_Bho_ (“mister”) is typically used by brahmins; he also uses it in reference to the king below. ",
  "mn90:14.19": "",
  "mn90:14.23": "Compare the discussion in the Jain Viyāhapaṇṇatti 6.9.144, where pure gods are beyond the scope of impure gods. ",
  "mn90:15.2": "If Pasenadi does not know Ānanda, this must be a very early encounter, perhaps his first. ",
  "mn90:15.4": "",
  "mn90:16.7": "Not only does Viḍūḍabha exhibit poor leadership by blaming a subordinate, he is evidently lying about it. "
