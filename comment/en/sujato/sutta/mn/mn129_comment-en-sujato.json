  "mn129:35.1": "bhinkara and abbhukirati only occur in this context, and deserve elevated renderings. ",
  "mn129:35.3": "vasam upeti is the same idiom used for arriving at a guest house. SN 42.13 ",
  "mn129:35.7": "Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). Translators have rendered these with “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. ",

  "mn129:45.1": "_Brāhmaṇagahapatikā_ means “brahmins and householders” rather than “brahmin householders”. It is a term for the “landed gentry”. A householder is a landowner, not just a lay person. Here the king is beloved of the upper class rather than the general populace (_negamajānapadā_). "
