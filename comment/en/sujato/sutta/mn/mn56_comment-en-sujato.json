  "mn56:1.2": "Pāvārika means “blanket-weaver”. Places were often named for their primary economic activity. Probably there was a community of blanket weavers and the park was owned by their leading merchant. ",
  "mn56:2.1": "Jain tradition holds that Mahāvīra passed at a Pāvā near Nāḷandā. Buddhist texts know only the Pāvā of the Mallians to the north. Evidently there has been some confusion, and perhaps “Pāvārika’s mango grove”, the site of discussions with Jains here and at [sn42.8](), is the Pāvā known to the Jains. Note, however, that the earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s passing, the Kalpasutra, does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha. ",
  "mn56:2.2": "In Sanskrit, Dīrghatapasvin was a common name, or rather epithet, for ascetics, meaning “long fervor” in honor of lengthy dedication to practices such as starvation. It is presumably the Dīgha Tapassī of this sutta who is inscribed in a Buddhist stupa at Bharhut teaching a group of students. At least one of his students appears to be holding a small stick, which may be a pictorial representation of the subject of this discourse. ",
  "mn56:3.5": "The term “rod” implies violence and punishment unlike the more neutral “deed”. This usage is found in such Jain texts as Uttarādhyayanasūtra 8.10. It was evidently common enough that it could be referred to obliquely as the “three rods” (20.60; see too Isibhāsiyāiṁ 25.2, 35.0.6). It is also found in Mahābhārata 12.228.034c. ",
  "mn56:3.12": "In Jainism, all three “rods” create _karma_, which in Jainism is a kind of subtle matter (_pudgala_) that adheres to and obscures the soul ( Tattvārthasūtra 6.1–2). Thus all _karma_ is material. Nonetheless, according to Dr. Hiralal Jain, *Jainism in Buddhist Literature*, the Jain position is not that physical actions are more important, since all three kinds of action must be intentional. Rather, it is that intentional actions performed through the body have a greater weight than those performed by speech or by thought alone. _Karma_ in the Jain system is the result of such intentional action, which clings to the soul as a form of matter. ",
  "mn56:4.4": "The terms _daṇḍa_ (“rod” or “punishment”) and _kamma_ (“deed”) are synonymous in Jainism. The three _daṇḍas_ of body, speech, and mind are also found in Manusmṛti 12.8. ",
  "mn56:5.1": "Bālaki is obscure. The commentary says it could mean either “foolish” (which seems harsh) or “from the village of the child salt miners” (which is obscure and distant, [mn128:7.1]()). A Dṛpta Bālāki of the Gārgya clan features in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.1.1, so perhaps it was a proper name (from _balāka_, “crane”). ",

In that passage, “restraint” refers to stopping the influx of defilements through the five senses, neither delighting in the pleasant nor loathing the unpleasant. | Read _vāri_ as future passive participle (cf. Sanskrit _vārya_). | _Dhuta_ in the sense “shaken off (evil by means of ascetic practices)” is a characteristic Jain term. | For _sabbavāriphuṭo_ compare _ophuṭo_ at [mn99:15.5]().

But Daṇḍa raped Arā, the daughter of the hermit Śukra. Śukra destroyed the country of Daṇḍa in a rain of fire. See too Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 3.5.

There, Mātaṅga features as a wise sage, and it is not clear to me how this relates to the wilderness of that name.
