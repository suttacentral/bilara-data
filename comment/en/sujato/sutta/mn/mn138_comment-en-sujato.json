  "mn138:20.1": "All Pali editions read “anxious because of not grasping”. Implausible though it is, this is accepted by the commentary, which offers an explanation. The Saṁyuttanikāya, however, has several similar passages that consistently have the expected “anxious because of grasping” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.7/en/sujato'>SN 22.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.8/en/sujato'>SN 22.8</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/22.90/en/sujato#3.13'>22.90:3.13</a>). It seems the Majjhima preserves an ancient error and the Saṁyutta reading should be preferred. "
