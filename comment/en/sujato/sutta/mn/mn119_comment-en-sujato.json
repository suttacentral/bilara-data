Bodhi reads it as a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dvanda</i> compound (“memories and thoughts”), which takes <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sara</i> as “memory” (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>smara</i> or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>smṛti</i>). The commentary, followed by Ānandajoti, explains it as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhāvanasaṅkappā</i> (“rushing thoughts”), which assumes the sense “flow” (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saras</i>). Support for the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dvanda</i> interpretation comes from Sanskrit texts, where we frequently find <i lang='pi' translate='no'>smṛtisaṁkalpa</i> as either two words (eg. Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.2) or a compound (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34). ",
  "mn119:4.8": "Each practice leads directly to immersion, reminding us that mindfulness meditation is “the basis of immersion” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhinimitta</i>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#12.3'>MN 44:12.3</a>). ",
  "mn119:6.1": "Obviously this passage is not suggesting that one enters deep meditation while going to the toilet. As per the Gradual Training, such practices form a foundation that prepares the mind for meditation. ",
  "mn119:7.7": "Such meditations, as also the contemplation on death that follow, lead to immersion by ridding the mind of desire. While the subject of meditation is perceived as unpleasant, when the mind is free of desire it gives rise to a pleasure imbued with lightness and freedom, and it is that pleasure that leads to immersion. ",
  "mn119:18.1": "In the Satipaṭṭhānasutta, the practice of absorption is implicit in the contemplation of feelings (as spiritual pleasure), mind (as immersed mind, etc.), and principles (as the awakening factor of immersion), while the four absorptions are mentioned explicitly in the expanded version (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato#21.32'>DN 22:21.32</a>). Here they take an even more central role. ",
  "mn119:18.2": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>phoṭṭhabba</i>), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>manomayakāya</i>), to the direct personal realization of highest truth (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato#23.2'>MN 70:23.2</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti</i>).

  "mn119:19.3": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss.

  "mn119:22.1": "By this, the Buddha is asserting that mindfulness of the body is not just the first of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, but encompasses all of them.

  "mn119:29.5": "The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati sati āyatane</i> is tricky. Syntactically, it is a locative absolute construction, which Bodhi treats as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i>, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Further, both accept the commentary’s gloss of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i> as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāraṇa</i> (“reason, basis”), although this sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i> is rare in the suttas (but see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.25/en/sujato#14.3'>SN 12.25:14.3</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.171/en/sujato#5.3'>AN 4.171:5.3</a>). These readings of the absolute construction give it a limiting sense; the benefits apply only insofar as there is a “suitable basis” or a “basis for mindfulness”. But the expression is used by the Buddha of himself (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.68/en/sujato#1.9'>AN 5.68:1.9</a>), so it seems odd that it would be limiting. Indeed, the tenor of the whole sentence is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized by the repeated reduplications: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati</i>, which have a distributive sense. I therefore take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as “being” in both cases; the reduplication of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as aligned with the preceding pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i>  in its normal sense of “scope, range”.
