  "mn1:1.1": "Just as the Dīghanikāya begins with the complex and demanding Brahmajālasutta, the Majjhima opens with one of the most abstruse discourses in the canon. It was translated together with its commentary and extensive analysis by Bhikkhu Bodhi as *The Discourse on the Root of Existence*. ",
  "mn1:1.2": "Ukkaṭṭhā, near Sāvatthī, is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins, likely because it was the home of the prominent Kosalan brahmin Pokkharasādi ([dn3:1.2.1](), [dn14:3.29.1](), [mn49:2.1]()). ",
  "mn1:2.1": "The pattern of this discourse responds to such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.7, where Yājñavalkya expounds a series of principles in relation to which the “immortal self” is conceived. ",
  "mn1:3.1": "An “unlearned ordinary person”, who has not realized any of the stages of the noble path, is contrasted with the “noble one” (_ariya_) or “good person” (_sappurisa_) who has entered the path. The sutta examines the ways that the process of perception and identification evolves with progress on the path. ",
  "mn1:3.2": "Their perception is accurate, not mistaken, confused, or deranged. Yet “perception” (_saññā_) is filtered through memory and concepts, a subtle pre-processing that adapts sense experience to our own experiences and desires. | A similar list, but with fewer items, is found starting at [mn49:11.1](). ",
  "mn1:3.3": "To “identify” or “conceive” (_maññati_) is to interpret experience in terms of a “self”. The experience is not left as it is, but becomes what it means *to me*. Each phrase expresses a different mode or manner of identification. ",
  "mn1:3.5": "“Complete understanding” (_pariññā_) is the understanding of the arahant that cuts through all delusions and conceits permanently. ",
  "mn1:4.1": "The sutta proceeds through the four main physical elements or properties before proceeding to beings and then various deities. The difference between these things is not as pronounced as one might think. The elements were worshiped as gods, while the gods were often anthropomorphized natural phenomena such as the sky (_deva_), or the thunder (_inda_). To identify with a material element, then, is to share the essence of a powerful force of nature. ",
  "mn1:7.1": "“Creatures” (_bhūta_) can refer to any living being, including humans and animals, as well as invisible entities such as ghosts. ",
  "mn1:8.1": "“Gods” (_deva_) or “deities” (_devatā_) is a generic description of the many divine entities of ancient Indian belief. Some were inherited from the old Vedic theology, while others reflect local customs and beliefs. All are impermanent and subject to suffering. ",
  "mn1:9.1": "This is Pajāpati, the lonely creator god of Vedic belief. Having set the world in motion he was largely forgotten. ",
  "mn1:10.1": "Brahmā is also regarded as a creator, but in the sense of the underlying divine force that sustains the life of the cosmos. In Buddhism, several individual Brahmās appear, depicted as high deities who achieved their status due to the practice of first _jhāna_ in a past life. ",
  "mn1:11.1": "This and the next two are higher Brahmā realms. Beings in this realm are sometimes called “gods” (_devā_). They achieved their status through the second, third, and fourth _jhānas_ respectively. Later Brahmanical texts mention a class of Ābhāsvara deities, but it does not appear to be a Vedic concept. ",
  "mn1:12.1": "“Replete with glory” is _subhakiṇha_, where _subha_ is “beauty, radiance, glory” and _kiṇha_ is “entire, total” (= Sanskrit _kṛtsna_). The same word is the basis for the Pali _kasiṇa_ (“universal”). The concept appears to be Buddhist, but we find a precedent when Yājñavalkya says that, just as salt is “entirely” salty, the Self is an “entire mass of consciousness” (_kṛtsnaḥ prajñānaghana eva_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.5.13). ",
  "mn1:13.1": "The gods of “abundant fruit” (_vehapphala_; Sanskrit _bṛhatphala_) do not appear in Brahmanical literature. But _bṛhat_ is a common descriptor of divinity. See eg. the Vedic god Bṛhaspati, identified with the planet Jupiter, or Rig Veda 9.107.15, which describes Soma as _ṛtam bṛhat_, “vast and true”. ",
  "mn1:14.1": "“Vanquisher” (_abhibhū_) is an epithet of Brahmā ([mn49:5.2]()) that was appropriated for the Buddha ([an4.23:5.1]()). In Rig Veda 8.97.10 it is an epithet of Indra, but it is not a regular name for a deity in either Buddhism or Brahmanism. Here it appears to be the name of the highest of the Brahmā gods. ",
  "mn1:15.1": "Here begins the series of realms associated with the practice of formless meditations. These were practiced by the most advanced non-dualist Brahmanical teachers before the Buddha, who “identified” such experiences with the highest Self that is the cosmic divinity. The Buddha adopted the practices as part of the development of meditation, divesting them of metaphysical significance. ",
  "mn1:15.2": "“Space” (_ākāsa_) is a principle of deep significance in the Upaniṣads, yet it is ultimately a lesser manifestation of the Absolute. See eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.7; Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.1.1; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.12. ",
  "mn1:16.1": "“Infinite consciousness” is identified with the highest Self by Yājñavalkya at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12. ",
  "mn1:17.1": "Taught by the Brahmanical sage Āḷāra Kālāma at [mn26:15.13](). ",
  "mn1:18.1": "Taught by the Brahmanical sage Uddaka Rāmaputta at [mn26:16.13](). ",
  "mn1:19.1": "The discourse presents four items—the seen, heard, thought, and known—which describe the means of knowing spiritual truths: the sight of a holy person, hearing a teaching, contemplating the truth, and meditative awareness. This framework, which is found commonly in the suttas, was adopted from Yājñavalkya; for example at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.8.11 he describes the Absolute as “the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker, the unknown knower”. ",
  "mn1:19.2": "See [snp4.4]() for a more detailed critique of “seeing” a holy person as a standard of truth. ",
  "mn1:20.1": "This refers to teachings that are “heard” or passed down in oral tradition. It includes Vedic scriptures (_śruti_) that were believed to have been “heard” or transmitted by divine inspiration, as well Buddhist scriptures, which begin, “So I have heard”. No scripture is infallible ([mn76:25.2]()). ",
  "mn1:21.1": "_Muta_ means “(what is) thought”, but is often mistranslated as “sensed”, a meaning that does not apply in the early texts. Philosophical thought, like scripture, is fallible ([mn76:27.3]()), but people get attached to their theories ([snp4.5]()). ",
  "mn1:22.1": "The “known” (_viññāta_) is that which is cognized with consciousness (_viññāṇa_), especially states of expanded consciousness in deep meditation. Even such states are not immune to misinterpretation (eg. [mn136:9.1](), [dn1:1.31.1]()). ",
  "mn1:23.1": "Perception of “oneness” (_ekatta_) is associated with deep meditation, and it interprets the world as reflective of that same unity. It is associated with the non-dual schools of Brahmanism. Īśa Upaniṣad 7, for example, speaks of “contemplating the oneness” (_ekatvam anupaśyataḥ_) of all creatures with the supreme soul. ",
  "mn1:24.1": "“Diversity” (_nānatta_) is the opposite fallacy to “oneness”; based on the diversity of sense experience, it interprets the world as irreducibly manifold. An example would be the Jains, who believed the world was made up of countless separate entities, a view criticized in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3.13 (_nānātvaṁ nindyate_). Both these fallacies take a particular mode of perception, which is true in certain respects, and apply it as an absolute. ",
  "mn1:25.1": "The “all” is another critical term in the Upaniṣads, representing the totality of creation as an expression of divinity. See eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.25.2, “the self is all this” (_ātmaivedaṃ sarvamiti_). In his third discourse, speaking to Brahmanical ascetics, the Buddha reframed the “all” as the experience of the six senses ([sn35.28]()). "
