  "mn44:1.3": "These two are little-known, in contrast with the previous _vedalla_ featuring a dialogue between two mendicants renowned for their wisdom. | Dhammadinnā was recognized as the foremost bhikkhunī in teaching ([an1.239:1.1]()), presumably on the basis of this sutta, and has a single verse to her name ([thig1.12]()). | Visākha is otherwise unmentioned in the canon. The commentary says this is not is the mendicant known as Visākha, Pañcāli’s son ([thag2.45](), [an4.48](), [sn21.7]()). ",
  "mn44:2.1": "The normal form of address for nuns is _ayyā_ (“ma’am”). It is from the root _ariya_ (“noble”); the masculine form is occasionally used for monks as well. | “Substantialism” is _sakkāya_. It is formed from _sat_ (“real”) and _kāya_ (“substance”). The Jain form is _astikāya_, which refers to the five fundamental substances of soul, the media of motion and rest, matter, and space. Note that the suttas use _kāya_ as a key doctrinal term for ascetic movements associated with Jainism (eg. [dn2:23.3](), [dn2:26.2]()), whereas _kāya_ appears to have had no philosophical importance, if indeed it appears at all, in pre-Buddhist Vedic texts. The commentaries define _sakkāya_ as “the three planes of cyclic existence”, i.e. all that exists. Thus _sakkāya_ is the identification of a “real substance” that is a candidate for being taken as “self”. ",
  "mn44:24.2": "“Change” doesn’t really work for viparinama here. I’m eating a yoghurt—yum! Someone gives me an ice-cream—yummier! Same for below; changing from one form of torture to another is not pleasant. Viparinama usually means “perish”, and so it must be here. "
