  "mn26:1.1": "This discourse is known in Pali manuscripts and commentaries either as “The Noble Quest” or “The Pile of Snares”, whereas the Chinese parallel at MA 204 is titled “The Discourse at Rāma’s Hermitage”. It is one of several discourses in the Majjhima that include a partial account of Siddhattha’s practice before awakening, an account that became one of the key events in the Buddha’s biography. This particular version focuses on his experience with Brahmanical teachers, while <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato'>MN 36</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato'>MN 85</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato'>MN 100</a> include a long passage detailing his Jain-like fervent austerities.

  "mn26:2.3": "Why was the Buddha reluctant to teach? This is puzzling because where we find this trope elsewhere there is a clear reason: at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.52/en/sujato#1.3'>AN 7.52:1.3</a> the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to Campā, while at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81/en/sujato#3.5'>SN 22.81:3.5</a> he had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. Here, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, there is no such reason. Rather, the events are best understood as narrative foreshadowing. His reluctance requires an intervention by others, and when the teaching finally takes place it is not in a Buddhist monastery but on Brahmanical grounds. The story goes on to tell how, after his awakening, he was reluctant to teach until the intervention of Brahmā (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#19.1'>MN 26:19.1</a>). This narrative mirroring creates a hidden link (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sandhi</i>) that frames the awakening in a Brahmanical context. The very obscurity of the connection is the point, for “the gods love hidden things”. The theme of reluctance is extended further to the reluctance of the five mendicants to receive the Buddha. It draws on the precedent of Yājñavalkya’s reluctance to teach Janaka (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1). ",

Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhipatya</i>) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1). The root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pati</i> (“lord”) here establishes a linguistic link with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahampati</i>.

Its Vedic meaning was “immortality”, and hence the “ambrosia” of soma through which immortality was gained. For the Buddha, as seen in the “noble quest” itself, it was the freedom from the cycles of birth, aging, and death. ",
  "mn26:20.20": "Here we see a verbal echo of Sahampati’s martial origins. ",
  "mn26:21.2": "Here we see the sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>indriya</i> as “spiritual potential”. Originally it was the state of excited energy produced by soma that allowed Indra to manifest his full power and overcome his foes. It implicitly links back to the five spiritual qualities that the Buddha attributed to his teachers, which he later formalized as “faculties”. Here as there, the idea creates a connection between beings, a recognition of shared qualities that, when properly nurtured, can mature into awakening. ",
  "mn26:21.7": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ</i> has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pamuñcantu</i> is “release”. Sanskrit variants include <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pramodantu</i> (“celebrate”) or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ</i> (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhimuñcantu</i>, to “decide” or “commit” to faith. Pali commonly uses synonymous verbs to reinforce the sense of the noun. In <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato'>Snp 5.19</a>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>muttasaddho</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pamuñcassu saddhaṁ</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhimuttacittaṁ</i> are all used in this sense. ",
  "mn26:23.14": "While this passage is clearly heightened for dramatic effect, it is not surprising that they have passed away. It has been several years since he studied with these teachers, and they were probably elderly at the time, as perhaps hinted in their eagerness to appoint Siddhattha as heirs. ",
  "mn26:24.5": "The five mendicants appear abruptly here and the reason for their behavior is only clear in light of the fuller accounts (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#33.4'>MN 36:33.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#33.4'>MN 85:33.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn100/en/sujato#30.5'>MN 100:30.5</a>). The Buddha’s praise for them is more muted than for the Brahmanical teachers, showing how he valued advanced meditation over austerities. | Note that he calls them “mendicants”, a term typically reserved for Buddhist renunciates. For a similar usage, see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn140/en/sujato#3.4'>MN 140:3.4</a>. ",

Upaka is met only here; his name means “nearly there”. | The place of awakening is referred to as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bodhi</i>. These places are about twenty kilometers apart. ",
  "mn26:25.3": "Here “faculties” refers to visible features such as bright eyes. Compare Chāndogya Upaniṣad 4.14.2, where a students face is seen as bright and glowing due to their recent insights. ",
  "mn26:25.21": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Āhañchaṁ</i> is first person future singular of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āhanati</i>, “one beats”. ",
  "mn26:25.22": "“Infinite Victor” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anantajina</i>) is unknown elsewhere and may be an Ājīvaka term. It relates to the epithet <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jina</i> of the teacher Mahāvīra, after which his followers the Jains were named. Mahāvīra and the Ājīvaka founder Gosāla practiced together for six years, so it comes as no surprise that they shared terminology. ",

Taken together with the abrupt skip at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#18.1'>MN 26:18.1</a> above, and the equally abrupt mention of the five mendicants at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#24.5'>MN 26:24.5</a>, it seems likely the passage on the austerities has been removed in order to focus on the Brahmanical context.

  "mn26:31.1": "The Buddha rather abruptly returns to a direct teaching for the mendicants in Rammaka’s hermitage.
