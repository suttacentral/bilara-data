  "mn88:8.3": "The commentary says that Pasenadi’s actions were occasioned by the brutal murder of the wanderer Sundarī. Unscrupulous ascetics urged her to visit the Jeta Grove, then killed her so that blame would fall on the Buddha and his community (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud8.4/en/sujato'>Ud 8.4</a>). However, nothing in this sutta or its parallel at MA 214 supports this connection. ",
  "mn88:9.2": "Ānanda completed Pasenadi’s phrasing by adding “sensible” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññūhi</i>), since the Buddha’s conduct was in fact faulted by foolish ascetics and brahmins. ",

  "mn88:10.4": "“Blameworthy” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāvajja</i>) behavior is that which makes one liable to criticism by others. This is the social dimension of immorality. ",
  "mn88:10.6": "“Hurtful” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sabyābajjha</i>) refers to the fact that bad conduct is characterized by hurtful affliction both in its action and its consequences. ",
