  "mn3:2.1": "“Things of the flesh” renders _āmisa_, literally “meat”. In Vedic sacrifice the flesh of the slaughtered beast was made holy and fit for the gods (Rig Veda 1.162.10). In this way the guilt of killing was assuaged and the flesh became allowable for the brahmin priests. Here the “flesh” is extended by implication to the material pleasures of the world. ",
  "mn3:2.4": "Text’s _ādiya_ (and variant _ādissā_) are future passive participles from √_dis_ (“point”) having the sense “liable to be pointed out or accused”. ",
  "mn3:3.1": "A mendicant tries to eat just what they need. In some circumstances, especially when eating on invitation in a house, the donors will first place a modest amount of food in the bowl, then offer more during the meal if it is needed. This passage concerns such extra food that has been refused. ",

  "mn3:5.1": "Sāriputta continues on a similar theme, phrased in terms of “seclusion” (_viveka_) rather than “things of the flesh” (_āmisa_). Seclusion is explained in the commentaries as threefold: physical seclusion achieved by living a virtuous life in a quiet place; mental seclusion from the hindrances achieved through the _jhānas_; and seclusion from attachments, namely Nibbāna.

  "mn3:6.5": "“Senior mendicants” (_therā bhikkhū_) are those ordained more than ten rains retreats. ",
