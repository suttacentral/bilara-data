  "mn72:1.1": "This sutta depicts Vacchagotta, having gained a degree of faith as depicted in [mn71](), question the Buddha regarding the undeclared points. This is just a taste of Vacchagotta’s curiosity, as the 55 suttas of SN 33 all deal with the same topic, as do [sn44.7](), [sn44.8](), and [sn44.11](). Underlying all these questions is the assumption of a self, which Vacchagotta asks directly about at [sn44.10](). ",
  "mn72:9.1": "",
  "mn72:15.2": "The Buddha, or indeed any arahant, has no “convictions” (_diṭṭhigata_), i.e. theories to attach to, since his “right view” (_sammādiṭṭhi_) is grounded in what he has “seen” (_diṭṭha_). ",
  "mn72:15.9": "At [thag14.2](), _mathita_ means “oppressed, weighed down”, and the same sense probably applies at [thag1.102](). At [dhp349](), however, the root sense of “churn” fits the context of “thoughts”, while at [mn90:12.14]() it refers to starting a fire by “churning” with a fire-drill, a common Vedic usage (Rig Veda 3.23.1a, 3.29.12a, 8.48.6a; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.1.4.8, 3.7.3.3, etc.). Its unique appearance in this context anticipates the simile of fire. ",
  "mn72:18.1": "Vacchagotta’s confusion on this same point is addressed at [sn44.9:5.3](). ",
  "mn72:18.4": "When Vacchagotta is out of his depth, the Buddha helps him by coming back to a simple, grounded metaphor. ",
  "mn72:19.7": "The language in this passage echoes key Buddhist doctrinal terms. Here, “depend” is _paṭicca_. ",
  "mn72:19.10": "“Fuel” is _upādāna_, normally translated as “grasping”. ",
  "mn72:19.11": "“Extinguished” is _nibbāyeyya_, a verbal form of Nibbāna. ",
  "mn72:20.1": "Here “realized one” (_tathāgata_) pertains to any arahant, as at [sn54.12](). The Pali commentary and one of the Chinese parallels here (SA2 196 at T ii 445a18) agree in saying that a “living being” (_satta_) is meant. However, _tathāgata_ and _satta_ are exact verbal parallels: _tathā_ (“real”) + _gata_ (“come to the state of”) and _sa_ (“real”) + _tta_ (“state of”). Thus it seems likely that this was originally intended as a mere verbal gloss to resolve the compound. ",
  "mn72:22.2": "Vacchagotta had already gone forth as a wanderer, so it is surprising that he calls himself a “lay follower” (_upāsaka_). The Chinese parallels simply say that he left without taking refuge (SA 962 at T ii 246a17 and SA2 196 at T ii 445c8). Given that the Pali tradition repeats him going for refuge in the next sutta ([mn73:15.2]()), it seems likely that this detail was added by mistake here. "
