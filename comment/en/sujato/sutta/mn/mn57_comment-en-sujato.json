",
  "mn57:2.1": "The cow votary (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>govatika</i>) is attested in Sanskrit (eg. Mahābhārata 5.97.13). Elsewhere, non-Buddhist texts mention snake votaries, fish votaries, those who live like beasts (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mṛgacaryā</i>), and others, but not, so far as I am aware, dog votaries. The cow and dog observances are found in later Buddhist texts (Yogacārabhūmi 157.10, Mahākarmavibhaṅga 44.19, Śikṣāsamuccaya 332.3, etc.) evidently drawing from this sutta. Thus, while no parallel of this sutta has survived, it was known in northern Buddhist traditions and must have been lost due to a failure of transmission. ",

  "mn57:4.8": "From a text of a later date, the cow observance is described thus: “One should bathe in the urine of a cow, maintain himself with milk, and move with the cows, eating after they had eaten. It is known as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>govrata</i>. One would become free from the sins in a month. He would attain the world of cows and reach heaven” (Agni Purāna 292:12–13a, Gangadharan’s translation). This is not a penance for burning off sin, but rather a way of elevating oneself through the sacred nature of the cow. It is not clear, however, if this is the same as the observance in the Buddha’s day. ",
