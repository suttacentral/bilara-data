  "mn111:1.1": "This discourse describes Sāriputta’s practice of discernment leading to awakening. It fills in the blanks between realizing stream entry and arahantship, reminding us that when a narrative depicts a person realizing the truth while listing to a teaching—as Sāriputta does—there is usually an extensive background of practice behind that. A number of indications suggest that this is among the later discourses: there are no parallels; the exposition is unusually elaborate; there is editorial clumsiness; and a number of terms are unique or characteristic of later texts.

The Vinaya gives it as an antonym to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambhinna</i>, “mixed” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd13/en/sujato#33.1.7'>Kd 13:33.1.7</a>). | The first five items here are the five so-called “jhāna factors”, which in the suttas appear here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn43/en/sujato#19.3'>MN 43:19.3</a>. The list summarizes the normal depiction of the first absorption, as the first four factors are all part of the standard first absorption formula, and all absorption or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i> is characterized by unification of mind (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn20/en/sujato#3.3'>MN 20:3.3</a>). | There is a striking syntactic break between the first five factors and the remainder of the list starting with “contact”. The five factors are articulated in the colloquial Pali fashion connected with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ca</i>, while the remainder are simply listed without <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ca</i>. This, together with the fact that the first five appear elsewhere as a set and the remainder do not, as well as the fact that the second list is partly redundant (eg. “feeling” is already covered in the five factors), makes it certain that the latter items were appended to the first five. Indeed, the appended items appear elaborated even compared with similar lists in the Abhidhamma (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dt1.2/en/sujato#16.1'>Dt 1.2:16.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/kv15.10/en/sujato#2.3'>Kv 15.10:2.3</a>; see too <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mil3.3.6/en/sujato#7.2'>Mil 3.3.6:7.2</a>).

  "mn111:4.2": "He was mindfully aware as the attainment characterized by these qualities arose, persisted, and fell away. As Anālayo points out, this cannot refer to observing the cessation of phenomena <em>inside</em> the absorption, as the absorption itself is defined by their persistence (<em>Early Buddhist Meditation Studies</em>, pp. 117 ff.). In other words, he was aware of the impermanence <em>of</em> absorption, not of impermanence <em>in</em> absorption. | Compare the “development of immersion” that contemplates feelings, perceptions, and thoughts in the same way (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.41/en/sujato#4.3'>AN 4.41:4.3</a>).

First comes “full knowledge of the known” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ñātapariññā</i>), where the meditator clearly observes each phenomena in experience. Then they reflect and scrutinize the “known” in light of the three characteristics of impermanence, suffering, and not-self, as Sāriputta is doing here (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tīraṇapariññā</i>).
