  "mn131:1.1": "A favorite of meditators, this discourse takes a distinctive set of verses as a template for explaining the aspect of meditation called  _vipassanā_, commonly rendered “insight”; for why I use  “discernment” see [dn14:1.37.5]() and note. The next three discourses explain the same verses on different occasions, with [mn133]() offering a complementary explanation. ",
  "mn131:3.2": "To “anticipate” (_paṭikaṅkhe_) is not always bad. A mendicant ought to “anticipate” dangers (_pāṭikaṅkhitabba_, [an4.122:1.1]() = [mn67:14.2]()); Nālaka “anticipates” the arrival of the Buddha (_patikkhaṁ_, [snp3.11:19.4]()); and an arahant “awaits their time” (_kālaṁ kaṅkhati_, [sn2.29:15.4]()). The verse here has a specific application in meditation, which is explained below. ",
  "mn131:3.5": "Here “phenomenon” (_dhamma_) means anything that is directly knowable (see [mn133:17.9]()). | The two verses run on here, as indicated by the _ca_ linking this line with the previous. ",
  "mn131:3.6": "For _tattha tattha_ as “in every case” see eg. [dn30:2.1.3](), and compare _tato tattha vipassati_ at [snp5.15:4.4](). ",
  "mn131:3.7": "At [thag14.1:5.1](), this phrase refers to the mind developed in meditation on love and compassion, while at [snp5.19:19.1]() it refers to Nibbana. In both cases, as here, it is the object of the verb, not an adverb. ",
  "mn131:3.8": "",
  "mn131:3.16": "The “peaceful sage” is the Buddha. ",
  "mn131:4.2": "_Samanvāneti_ is unique in early Pali, but the similar _samānayi_ is found at [dn30:1.33.4]() and [thig12.1:10.2]() in the sense of “reunite, bring together”. “Muster” means both to bring together and to arouse. ",
  "mn131:8.1": "_Dhammesu_ (“phenomena”) is plural here, whereas in the verse it is singular. Sanskrit fragments, however, have plural in the verse as well. "
