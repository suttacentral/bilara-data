  "mn2:1.1": "Both the Dīghanikāya and Majjhimanikāya open with a difficult philosophical text (Brahmajālasutta, Mūlapariyāyasutta) and follow them with a more practical teaching (Sāmaññaphalasutta, Sabbāsavasutta). ",
  "mn2:2.1": "This opening follows the pattern of [mn1](). ",
  "mn2:3.1": "The “ending of defilements” (_āsavānaṁ khayaṁ_) is a common Sutta term for arahantship. | “Knowing and seeing” refers to the penetrating insight that arises from meditative immersion (_samādhi_, eg. [an5.168:2.2](), [an10.2:2.3](), [sn12.23:6.18](), [dn2:83.1]()). ",
  "mn2:3.3": "“Rational application of mind” (_yoniso manasikāra_) is a distinctively Buddhist term. But it appears to draw on the frequent Vedic image of the “womb of truth” (_yonāv ṛtasya_, Rig Veda 9.13.9), the source of the laws and patterns that govern the natural order. The idea is that by applying the mind by way of cause or reason the hidden truth can be uncovered. ",
  "mn2:8.5": "The views mixing self and not-self might seem incoherent, but they are an important aspect of Upanishad theories. Yajnavalkya especially denied that many things were the self, only to finally affirm brahmin=vijnana as the true self. ",
  "mn2:8.9": "For these terms, see my note on SN 12.35. The idea of thicket and desert is that they are without nourishment or fruit, you lose your way. I think the underlying metaphor of visuka and vippandita here is that the views are essentially illusions, dodges or tricks of the mind to convince you that you understand, are in control. But it is just endless flopping back and forth. ",
  "mn2:19.3": "BB has “suspect” for okappeti, however this means rather the opposite, to “believe, hold, trust”. Cone takes this in the sense I mention. Thanks to Brahmali for pointing this out. "
