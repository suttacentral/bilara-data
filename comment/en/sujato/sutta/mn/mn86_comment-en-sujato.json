  "mn86:2.1": "This is a rare sutta where the Buddha’s words take a back seat to dramatic narrative. The reform of the serial killer Aṅgulimāla became one of the most popular stories in Buddhism, with is its message of redemption even for the most wicked. The narrative with extensive backstory has been elaborated in the Pali commentaries and several parallels, with various overlaps and divergences, where events become inflated to an implausible degree. The tendency to exaggeration is found even here, for example in the claim that Aṅgulimāla laid waste to entire countries. ",
  "mn86:2.3": "Aṅgulimāla’s eponymous grotesquerie of a “finger garland” is explained by the commentary and some parallels as being a count of his victims killed by order of his former Brahmanical teacher, who assigned him this task out of jealousy. This unlikely scenario was rejected by Richard Gombrich (<em>How Buddhism Began</em>, pg. 151), who proposed that Aṅgulimāla belonged to a violent cult. The shared core of canonical accounts, however, ascribe no religious motivation to his acts: he is just a killer. He is driven by untrammeled will to power, the need to show he is stronger and better. ",
