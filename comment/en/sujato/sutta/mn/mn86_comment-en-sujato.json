  "mn86:3.9": "Saṁharitvā saṁharitvā is the obvious reading. But comm. says “Saṅkaritvā saṅkaritvāti saṅketaṁ katvā vaggavaggā hutvā” where sanketa evidently relies on sankaritva, but the term is read as implying “grouped”, i.e. samharitva. A sign of an old corruption? Also, note that the idiom is emphatic.",
  "mn86:3.10": "Attha in hatthattha is attha2, as per comm: “Hatthatthaṁ gacchantīti hatthe atthaṁ vināsaṁ gacchanti”, a point overlooked by most translators.",
  "mn86:4.7": "pasayha manne is obscure here, and this is a guess at the sense.",
  "mn86:6.11": "taking me to apply to mahita; I prefer this because of proximity and thinness; it adds less meaning. Readings as per PTS, etc.",
  "mn86:9.4": "BB’s “attacking” seems a little excessive for kupita.",
  "mn86:14.2": "Mulha here should be connected with the common sense of having “lost” the path, and hence unable to emerge. See Ud 2.8. The modern term is obstructed labor.",
  "mn86:14.4": "_Garbakleśa_ in Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa 22.45 evidently has the sense, “travails of childbirth”.",
  "mn86:18.25": "pappuyya is absolutive, not optative as per BB."
