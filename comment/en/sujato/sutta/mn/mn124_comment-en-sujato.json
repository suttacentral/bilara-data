  "mn124:1.1": "Bakkula is depicted as an exponent of austerity who goes significantly beyond the norm in the early texts. According to the commentary, this sutta was added by the Elders at the Second Council, a century after the Buddha’s passing. This is supported by the lack of mention of where the Buddha is staying; by the advanced age of Bakkula; and by multiple textual indications. Bakkula apparently represents an ideal among a certain wing of the Saṅgha at that time. His verses in the Theragāthā, however, are simple and free from this severity (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag3.3/en/sujato'>Thag 3.3</a>). ",
  "mn124:2.1": "The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>purāṇagihisahāya</i> (“old friend from the lay life”) appears only here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.9/en/sujato#1.1'>SN 41.9:1.1</a>. There it is also said of a naked ascetic (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>acela</i>) called Kassapa, which cannot be a coincidence. In that case he, as the former friend of the householder Citta, is the one interrogated, in a discourse set while the Buddha was still alive. The events of the present discourse happened many decades after the Buddha’s death, so it seems likely Kassapa was introduced as a conventional foil for Bakkula. Several such individuals named Kassapa are found in Pali, and their stories are conflated (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato'>DN 8</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.17/en/sujato'>SN 12.17</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.9/en/sujato'>SN 41.9</a>).

  "mn124:3.2": "One may “go forth” at fifteen or “when old enough to scare crows” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#51.1.14'>Kd 1:51.1.14</a>), so he is probably over ninety here. ",
  "mn124:3.8": "This repetition is found in the PTS and BJT editions, but missing from MS and King of Siam editions. ",
  "mn124:3.10": "According to the commentary, these responses were added by the Elders, representing praise of Bakkula’s austerities by the successful rigorist party at the Second Council. This is supported by several considerations. First, the commentators would rather claim something is early, so when they say it was added later it likely comes from a genuine tradition. Second, the refrains are in plural. Third, the refrains, and the statements of Bakkula that they answer, lack the close <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ti</i> indicating a direct quote. Fourthly, they continue after the conversation with Kassapa has concluded. The refrains are also found in the Chinese parallel. This shows how comparing different versions of a sutta can take us back only to the point where the texts diverge, which was some time after the Second Council. Thus a shared feature might have been added a century or more after the Buddha. ",
  "mn124:9.1": "From a discussion of mental purity, Bakkula proceeds to list a series of details of conduct, which are not morally reprehensible, but which illustrate his extreme commitment to austerity. | Accepting a robe from a householder implies enjoying the spoils of wealthy donors. Austere monks wore robes made of cast-off rags. Compare the story of Ānanda at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn52/en/sujato#16.2'>MN 52:16.2</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an11.16/en/sujato#11.2'>AN 11.16:11.2</a>, or at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.13.1'>Kd 21:1.13.1</a>, where he explained that after accepting quality robes, they were shared and reused. | This sutta can be seen as representing one of the disputing factions at the Second Council (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/sujato'>Kd 22</a>). The Saṅgha was divided between “rigorists” who advocated a more austere monastic life, and “laxists” who wanted to take a more relaxed attitude to discipline. The Second Council decided ten points of Vinaya in the rigorists’ favor, the most important of which was whether monastics could use money. Bakkula represents a rigorist position so extreme that if it were followed generally it would undermine the very existence of the Saṅgha. His severity, which even exceeds that of Mahākassapa, is implicitly contrasted with the gentle and accommodating spirit of Ānanda. ",
