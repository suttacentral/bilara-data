  "mn115:3.2": "Notice the different approaches used by Ānanda and Sāriputta in the previous discourse. Sāriputta took up the Buddha’s teaching and elaborated it, whereas Ānanda uses inquiry to prompt the Buddha himself to speak further. ",
  "mn115:4.1": "As emphasized in this sutta, the notion of an “element” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhātu</i>) is a flexible one, including a range of different properties, qualities, or aspects of existence. ",

  "mn115:15.1": "It is unclear why this is mentioned, and since the Chinese parallel MA 181 lacks this passage entirely, it may be a later addition. It is of no apparent spiritual relevance, since in early Buddhist texts there is no concept of aspiring to become a Buddha in future lives. A woman may, of course, realize full liberation as an arahant, so the issue is not spiritual prowess. As to the reasoning underlying the claim, in this passage the Buddha is followed by a wheel-turning monarch, Sakka, Māra, and Brahmā. What they all have in common is that they are leaders. Since leaders of the time were men, perhaps it was assumed that people would not follow a woman in that role. This reasoning would also seem to be behind the idea that the Buddha was born either an aristocrat or a brahmin, whichever was the leading class of the time (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.5.1'>DN 14:1.5.1</a>).

  "mn115:18.1": "The qualification “for that reason” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>taṁnidānā tappaccayā</i>) is essential, as it is quite possible for someone to engage in bad conduct and later take a good rebirth due to other deeds.
