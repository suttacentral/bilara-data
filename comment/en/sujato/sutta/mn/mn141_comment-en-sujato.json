  "mn141:2.1": "This is in reference to the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta, the so-called First Sermon ([sn56.11]()), for which the current discourse serves as a canonical commentary. ",
  "mn141:3.1": "The four noble truths are sometimes said to be like a doctor who identifies the illness, discerns its cause, understands the recovery, and administers the cure until the patient is restored to health (SA 389 at T ii 105a25; SA-2 254 at T ii 462c10). This analogy is not found in the Pali canon. ",
  "mn141:5.4": "To extol his leading students, the Buddha recalls his own upbringing, born of Māyā and raised by Mahāpajāpatī (who appears in the next discourse). Nonetheless, _janetā_ is a masculine noun and it would be misleading to translate it as “mother”. Both mother and father “give birth” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.4.14; the creator is male at 1.4.4). ",
  "mn141:5.5": "_Āpādetā_ is a causative agent noun from _ā_ + _√pad_ in the sense “one who raises”. Again, both mother and father are “raisers” (_āpādakā_) of the child ([an4.63:2.6]()). ",
  "mn141:11.1": "Here Sāriputta takes the analysis a step further than the Dhammacakkappavattanasutta. This extended analysis of the truths was adopted from here into [dn22:18.4](), which further expanded the sections on the second and third noble truths in Abhidhamma style shared with [vb4](). | The definitions of rebirth, old age, and death are standard in dependent origination ([sn12.2:4.2]()), and are taught by Sāriputta also at [mn9:22.2](). ",
  "mn141:20.1": "The five aggregates sum up the entirety of suffering, since all suffering is experienced within and by means of the aggregates. ",
  "mn141:21.1": "The second and third noble truths are here analyzed to the same level of depth as the First Sermon, with no further definition of terms. See [mn9:16.2]() for notes. ",
  "mn141:24.2": "From here we have the standard definitions of the items of the noble eightfold path ([sn45.8:3.2](); compare [mn117]()). | Ignorance is described in the opposite way ([mn9:64-66.7](), [sn12.2:14.2]()). ",
  "mn141:26.1": "The items of right speech and right action are covered in greater detail under the ten pathways of skilful deeds at [mn41:12.4](). "
