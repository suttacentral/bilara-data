  "mn114:1.1": "The Buddha begins by speaking of what should and should not be cultivated. Then he goes on to offer three distinct analyses of this, each laid out in a series of dichotomies. After each one, Sāriputta offers a lengthy elaboration, which the Buddha then approves and recapitulates. ",
  "mn114:2.1": "To “cultivate” is to foster or nurture through repeated association or practice. ",
  "mn114:3.1": "The first analysis consists of seven items: bodily, verbal, and mental conduct; arising of thought; and acquisition of perception, views, and reincarnation. ",
  "mn114:3.3": "",
  "mn114:3.19": "“Life-form” is _attabhāva_, literally the “state of the self”, where the “self” comes close in meaning to “body”—whether material or immaterial—which is a secondary sense of _ātman_ in the Upaniṣads. Accordingly, the commentary to [an5.100]() glosses as _sarīrapaṭilābha_. | “Reincarnation” is _paṭilābha_. In the 20th century, Buddhist writers shied away from using “reincarnation”, which they associated with the Hindu idea of a transmigrating soul. But there is nothing in the word “reincarnation” that implies a soul. Rather, it simply refers to going into another body, which is precisely what is meant by _attabhāva_. It is unwise to hang a heavy philosophical cloak upon the feeble hook of a single word. ",
  "mn114:4.1": "Sāriputta proceeds to elaborate each of the seven items in turn. ",
  "mn114:5.8": "This includes the first three precepts, or else the first three of the ten ways of skillful deeds. ",
  "mn114:6.8": "This is the four verbal ways of skillful deeds. ",
  "mn114:7.8": "This is the final three ways of skillful deeds. ",
  "mn114:8.8": "The discussions at [mn8:13.1]() and [an7.53]() show that this refers to the initial thought that precedes action. ",
  "mn114:9.8": "Perception precedes even thought. ",
  "mn114:10.8": "A view is a perception solidified into a persistent pattern of thought, which becomes a way of seeing the world. View offer explanatory power, provide us with a convenient template for understanding, and often dismissing, what we encounter. Once a view has set in, it tends to reinforce itself, and hence is very slow to change. ",
  "mn114:11.10": "As the examples will show, this refers to a kind of rebirth that is not conducive to developing wholesome qualities. ",
  "mn114:11.11": "_Apariniṭṭhitabhāvāya_ (“not for the sake of the state of perfection”) is found only here. The commentary explains it in terms of individuals who are reborn in a painful state where they are unable to realize the accomplishment of liberation. ",
  "mn114:11.12": "The question is absent in the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, but present in the PTS and BJT editions. ",
  "mn114:12.1": "This completes the elaboration of the seven items. ",
  "mn114:22.1": "Now the Buddha introduces the second analysis, in terms of the six senses. ",
  "mn114:23.2": "Sāriputta proceeds to elaborate these six items in terms of what gives rise to the skillful and unskillful. ",
  "mn114:39.1": "The Buddha introduces the third and final analysis, which shifts to the requisites and residence of a monastic. ",
  "mn114:40.2": "Once again Sāriputta elaborates. "
