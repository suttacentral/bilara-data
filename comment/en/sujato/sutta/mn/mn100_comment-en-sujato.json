  "mn100:3.5": "_Tāta bhadramukha_ is unique, and I think it is deliberately condescending. “Oh, sweetie!”",

  "mn100:42.5": "The idiomatic instrumental _ṭhanaso_ is used in two ways in the suttas: “immediately, on the spot”, and “in terms of cause”, where it typically appears in the context of rebirth, and is followed by a verb of knowing (_ṭhānaso hetuso vipākaṁ yathābhūtaṁ pajānāti_). That this context is, in fact, about rebirth, is confirmed by the parallel phrase at mn90:13.2, which there is explained in terms of rebirth. The Buddha was phrasing his reply so as to avoid the implied metaphysical absolutism in the question.",
  "mn100:42.13": "The Buddha made a mild logical leap, assuming that Saṅgārava would follow him. The slightly clumsy misunderstanding in this passage strikes me as quite naturalistic dialogue."
