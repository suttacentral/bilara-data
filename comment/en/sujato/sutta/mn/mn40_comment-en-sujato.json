It sounds bizarre, and I have not been able to trace this practice elsewhere, but people do a lot of bizarre things. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pītanisita</i> may mean “sharpened with a wet (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pīta</i>) stone” per the commentary, or else “sharpened with yellow arsenic” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pīta</i>). Arthaśāstra 2.14.48 describes how metals may be rubbed with yellow arsenic (here = <i lang='pi' translate='no'>haritāla</i>) to disguise them. This fits the context, where a supposed monk wrapped in the ocher robe is like the metal, outwardly shiny yellow, but inside is deadly. ",

The term is of Sanskritic form and is found commonly in the Avadāna literature. Turning to later Sanskrit sources, Nāṭyaśāstra 19.12 says it should be used when addressing inferiors, while Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.154 says it is used when addressing a prince (see SN 3.7 above). The early Pali usage, however, suggests it was an affectionate and respectful term of somewhat elevated usage, but not restricted by status. Since <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhadda</i> by itself is a common form of address in the sense “my dear”, I think the suffix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-mukha</i> has its intensive sense here, “dearest”, rather than “dear face”.
