  "mn40:1.1": "This sutta deals with a similar topic to the previous, with differences in phrasing and content. ",
  "mn40:3.1": "These are forms of “misapprehension of precepts and observances” which do not in and of themselves signify spiritual purity. ",
  "mn40:3.2": "Compare the “corruptions of the mind” at [mn7:3.2](). ",
  "mn40:4.1": "“Deadborn” (_mataja_) is explained by the commentary as meaning forged from iron filings recovered from the corpse of a dead heron, which was force-fed them for that purpose. It sounds bizarre, and I have not been able to trace this practice elsewhere, but people do a lot of bizarre things. | _Pītanisita_ may mean “sharpened with a wet (_pīta_) stone” per the commentary, or else “sharpened with yellow arsenic” (_pīta_). Arthaśāstra 2.14.48 describes how metals may be rubbed with yellow arsenic (here = _haritāla_) to disguise them. This fits the context, where a supposed monk wrapped in the ocher robe is like the metal, outwardly shiny yellow, but inside is deadly. ",
  "mn40:5.3": "Wearers of dust and dirt are mentioned at [dn8:14.18]() and [dn25:8.16](), along with several other items on this list; see too [dhp141]() and [thag4.5:1.2](), and the description of the Bodhisatta at [mn12:46.5](). Some ascetics, such as Jains, did not bathe. ",
  "mn40:5.9": "",
  "mn40:6.2": "_Bhadramukha_ is used here by family for a child; by lay people addressing monks at [mn81:21.1](); by a laywoman addressing a deity at [an7.53:3.4](); by a king of his grown son at [sn3.7:1.5](); and, with the addition of the familiar _tāta_, by a brahmin wife to her husband at [mn100:3.5](). The term is of Sanskritic form and is found commonly in the Avadāna literature. Turning to later Sanskrit sources, Nāṭyaśāstra 19.12 says it should be used when addressing inferiors, while Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.154 says it is used when addressing a prince (see SN 3.7 above). The early Pali usage, however, suggests it was an affectionate and respectful term of somewhat elevated usage, but not restricted by status. Since _bhadda_ by itself is a common form of address in the sense “my dear”, I think the suffix _-mukha_ has its intensive sense here, “dearest”, rather than “dear face”. ",
  "mn40:13.3": "In such cases _pariḷāha_ refers to “heat exhaustion” rather than “fever”. "
