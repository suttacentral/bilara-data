  "mn89:20.4": "While the sutta and its parallels do not hint at anything other than a respectful visit to the Buddha, there is a tradition that this event led to Pasenadi’s downfall. Apparently, Dīgha Kārāyana blamed Pasenadi for the death of his uncle, Pasenadi’s former general Bandhula. Seeking revenge, he took the royal insignia and crowned Pasanadi’s dubious son Viḍūḍabha (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn90/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 90:6.1</a>) in his stead. Abandoned and alone, Pasenadi sought shelter in Rājagaha with his nephew Ajātasattu, but arrived too late and died while spending the night outside the walls. The details are improbable—why flee his friends the Sakyans for the untrustworthy Ajātasattu, 500 kms distant? And why would a city watch bar a king in need? Nonetheless, the outline of this story is found widely, not just in the Pali commentary (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja465/en/sujato'>Ja 465</a>, T 1451 at T xxiv 238c1, T 211 at T iv 583a16, D (6) <i lang='pi' translate='no'>’dul ba</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tha</i> 86a7).
