  "mn89:3.2": "The word _ārāma_, from a root meaning “to enjoy”, originally referred to a cultivated and pleasant parkland enjoyed for recreation. Such places were favorite dwelling places for ascetics, and became the sites for developed monasteries. In this sutta we see both senses. Here Pasenadi enjoys an _ārāma_ (“park”) for recreation. Below we see the Buddha staying in an _ārāma_ with a community of mendicants, featuring substantial private dwellings (_vihāra_) with lockable doors; in other words, a “monastery” ([mn89:8.1]()). ",

  "mn89:20.4": "While the sutta and its parallels do not hint at anything other than a respectful visit to the Buddha, there is a tradition that this event led to Pasenadi’s downfall. Apparently, Dīgha Kārāyana blamed Pasenadi for the death of his uncle, Pasenadi’s former general Bandhula. Seeking revenge, he took the royal insignia and crowned Pasanadi’s dubious son Viḍūḍabha ([mn90:6.1]()) in his stead. Abandoned and alone, Pasenadi sought shelter in Rājagaha with his nephew Ajātasattu, but arrived too late and died while spending the night outside the walls. The details are improbable—why flee his friends the Sakyans for the untrustworthy Ajātasattu, 500 kms distant? And why would a city watch bar a king in need? Nonetheless, the outline of this story is found widely, not just in the Pali commentary (see [ja465](), T 1451 at T xxiv 238c1, T 211 at T iv 583a16, D (6) _’dul ba_, _tha_ 86a7). "
