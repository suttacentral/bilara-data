  "mn139:3.1": "This is adapted from the first sermon; text has _kāmasukhamanuyuñjeyya_ which is a briefer expression that the original _kāmesu kāmasukhallikānuyogo_ at [sn56.11:2.3](). ",
  "mn139:3.9": "“Popular terms” is _janapadanirutti_. | _Samaññā_ (“label”, Sanskrit _samājñā_) ought not be confused with _sāmañña_ (“agreement”, “equality”, Sanskrit _sāmānya_). ",
  "mn139:12.3": "None of the terms below are regional or dialectical, so _janapadanirutti_ means “expressions current among the people”, “popular terms” rather than “regional dialects”. | A Sanskrit fragment paralleling this passage lists various words for “person”, which likewise are not regional or dialectical terms (SHT ii 163aA3: _(jīvo) vā jantur-vā (poṣo) vā pudgalo vā manujo_). ",
  "mn139:12.4": "All these terms are either attested in Pali and/or Sanskrit or are readily explicable from Pali roots. This is not about “translating” the Dhamma wholesale, but about using different popular terms, as in the U.S. they refer to the same thing as “soda” or “pop”. Compare [pli-tv-kd15:33.1.5](), which is about individuals giving their own glosses to terms (_sakāya niruttiya_). | _Pātī_ (“cup”) is from the root _√pā_, “to drink”, used in Pali for cups of bronze, gold, or silver. | _Patta_ (“bowl”), the masculine form of the same root, is the standard word for a mendicant’s alms bowl. | For _vittha_ (“jar”; variants _vitta_, _piṭṭha_) see _vitthaka_, a small jar for sewing gear ([pli-tv-kd15:11.5.15]()). | _Sarāva_ (“scoop”) is a common word for a scoop for water (eg. [an3.57:3.2](), [pli-tv-kd15:14.3.30](), [kv1.1:356.6](); Sanskrit _śarāva_, eg. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.1.4.12; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.8.1; Manu 6.56; also in Jain texts). | For _dhāropa_ (“vessel”) accept variant _harosa_ by analogy with _puṭosa_ ([mn118:8.9]()), yielding the sense “carrier for food”, “vessel”. | _Poṇa_ (“dish”) is probably a concave dish with “sloped” sides (cp. English “hollowware”). | _Pisīlava_ (“plate”) was used for the butter placed on the altar (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.3.6: _piśīle vā pātryau vā_). ",

  "mn139:14.3": "This was apparently prompted by Subhūti’s support of his fellow monk Saddha at [an11.14 ](), for which he was declared the foremost in living without conflict ([an1.201:1.1](); he was additionally praised as worthy of donations ([an1.202:1.1]().
