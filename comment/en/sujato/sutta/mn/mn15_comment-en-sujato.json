  "mn15:1.2": "The Bhaggas were an isolated republican clans, sandwiched between the Vacchas south of the Yamuna and the Kosalans north of the Ganges. By the time of the Buddha they were evidently subject to the Vacchas. | “Crocodile Hill” (_susumāragira_) was evidently the name of the capital city. Its name is something of a mystery, as the land is notably flat with the exception of a hill today called Pabhosa (also Prabhashgiri or Rohitgiri), which is today the site of a Jain temple. Perhaps it was this hill that from the river resembled a crocodile. The commentary, however, says it was so-named because a crocodile made a noise in a nearby lake during the founding of the city. ",
  "mn15:3.32": "_Apadāna_ means the traces or marks left behind, in this case the evidence of misdeeds. ",
  "mn15:6.1": "_Anumāna_ seems to only occur twice in the early texts, here and in the passive form _anumīyati_ at [sn22.36:1.4](), where the sense must be to “measure against”. The normal sense in later literature (eg. [mil6.4.1]()) is “inference”, which in the suttas is normally _anvaya_. This passage discusses how one is to compare oneself against another, an external standard, whereas the next section on reflection applies an inner standard. The commentary gloss is: “should measure against, should scrutinize, should examine”. "
