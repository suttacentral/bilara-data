Thus, drawing on the traditional imagery of _tapas_ as heat and fervor, it refers to the kindling of ascetic ardor. It never became a technical term in Pali, but in Sanskrit Abhidharma, _uṣmagata_ refers to the conjunction of radiant _samādhi_ with wisdom in the initial realization of the truths, which “burns up” the defilements (Abhidharmakoṣabhāṣya 6.17, Abhidharmasamuccaya 2.4).

Once the system of _aṅgas_ fell into disuse, some names were repurposed as specific books (Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka).

But Candrakīrti, drawing on the pan-Indic legend that certain serpents have a “snake-gem” (_nāgamaṇi_) in their heads, says that a serpent captured with the proper herbs and incantations brings great riches, but should these fail it will turn deadly (Mūlamadhyamakavṛtti-prasannapadā, L. de La Vallée Poussin’s translation, page 497).

See also the last words of a father to his son at 1.5.17: “You are divinity, you are the sacrifice, you are the cosmos” (_tvaṃ brahma tvaṃ yajñas tvaṃ loka_). | In this passage the terms _attā_ and _loko_ are reversed, presumably by textual error.

  "mn22:18.2": "By adding “externally” the focus is shifted from the self to “what belongs to the self”, namely possessions. However, the Chinese parallel at MA 200 apparently takes it in reference to the anxiety of an eternalist who hears the Buddha teaching “externally”. ",
