  "mn145:1.1": "This sutta recurs at [sn35.88]()), with slight differences in the opening and closing. In addition to two discourse parallels in Chinese, the popularity of this narrative is attested by its appearance in later texts such as the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya and the Divyāvadāna, as well as in artworks (see Anālayo, *Comparative Study*, vol. ii, p. 828). ",
  "mn145:1.3": "This Puṇṇa is to be distinguished from the Koliyan ascetic of [mn57]() and the son of Mantāṇī of [mn23](). His only other appearance is his Theragāthā verse at [thag1.70](). ",
  "mn145:5.2": "The commentary says that Puṇṇa was in fact born in Sunāparanta, specifically the trading port of Suppāraka, which is modern Nallasopara north of Mumbai on India’s west coast. Sunāparanta is otherwise known as Aparanta (“Far West”, [bv29:17.2]()). Puṇṇa’s choice was far-sighted, as from the time of Ashoka, Suppāraka became a major trading center with ports in India and lands west as far as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Eastern Africa, and Rome. A fabulous tale of such trading voyages is told in [ja463](). ",
  "mn145:5.32": "This is in reference to the notorious story of Migalaṇḍika in [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3](). Several monks, meditating improperly on the unattractiveness of the body, sought suicide as the way out. In response, the Buddha taught mindfulness of breathing, which is “peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation”. | The idiomatic phrase _satthahāraka_ and its verbal form _satthaṁ āharitaṁ_ are difficult. The obvious reading is to take _sattha_ as “knife”, the meaning it has in the preceding sentence. However, that yields the sense “knife-bringer”, “assasin”, whereas the use of _idaṁ_ in the current passage shows it must be neuter, i.e. it is a thing not a person. Richard Gombrich suggests we read _sattha_ here as equivalent to Sanskrit _śvasita_, “breathing, life” (see Brahmali’s note on [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1]()). This agrees with the Vinaya commentary, which explains, “What does it take? Life.” (_Kiṃ harati? Jīvitaṁ_). ",
  "mn145:7.5": "The parallel passage at [sn35.88:18.7](), says rather that he passed away in that same rainy season. "
