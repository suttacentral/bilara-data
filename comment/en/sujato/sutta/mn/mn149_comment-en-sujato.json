  "mn149:2.1": "For _āyatanika_ see [mn121:10.5](), where it refers to the life faculty of the body that is “related to the six sense fields”; there are also heavens and hells “related to the six fields of contact” ([mn50:22.2](), [sb35:35.135]()). In each case it refers to something that is connected to or related to the six sense fields, as indicated by the suffix _ika_. Here this refers to the fact that this discourse treats multiple distinct teaching frameworks in relation to the six sense fields. These include the majority of the _saṁyutta-mātikā_, the list of topics making up the Saṁyutta Nikāya. And this inclusive and integrative nature in turn explains why the teaching is “great”. ",
