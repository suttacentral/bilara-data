  "mn74:1.1": "This sutta records the occasion of the full enlightenment of the Buddha’s greatest disciple, Sāriputta, as well as the conversion of Dīghanakha. The commentary says this became the occasion for a unique four-factored gathering: it is the full moon in the month of Māgha; 1,250 mendicants spontaneously assemble; all were arahants with the six high knowledges; all were ordained by the “come, mendicant” formula. Today this is celebrated in the Makha Puja festival in Thailand. ",
  "mn74:2.1": "Dīghanakha means “Long-nails”; it must have been a nickname. Long nails are forbidden in the Vinaya ([pli-tv-kd15:27.1.21]()) and also to the one performing a Brahmanical consecration (_dīkṣā_, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.1.2). Further, EA 34.4 says that long nails (<span lang='lzh'>爪長</span>), uncut hair, and unwashed robes were disgraceful characteristics of ascetics. Ācārāṅgasūtra 2.8.5 speaks of the ascetic practice of abandoning the care of the hair of the head, beard, and nails. | Dīghanakha was Sāriputta’s nephew according to the Pali commentaries (not here, but in [mn111](), [sn11.2](), etc.) and northern texts such as Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra, Mahāvibhāṣā, and Avadānaśataka. ",
  "mn74:2.4": "Dīghanakha’s view “nothing is acceptable to me” (_sabbaṁ me nakkhamati_) is obscure, which seems to be the point. Sanskrit and Tibetan parallels to this passage are identical to the Pali, so when some Chinese translations say “no view” or “no teaching” is acceptable, this is probably because the translators felt the need to clarify, echoing the common expression, “the acceptance of a view after consideration” (_diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti_). This reading fits the text, but the sense may be broader than that. The closest phrasing in Pali is at [dn25:10.11](), where “this is not acceptable to me” (_idaṁ me nakkhamati_) refers to food that a picky monk rejects. Views about acceptable food are recorded in detail in Jain texts, and we may presume that other orders had similar systems. Strictness in such matters is seen as a sign of virtue, escalating ultimately to the refusal of all food. ",
  "mn74:2.5": "Aggivessana is his Brahmanical clan name. ",
  "mn74:2.6": "While this displays the Buddha’s ready wit, like much good humor it plays on a deeper anxiety. For it is easy to say that one believes in nothing, but the state of unknowing is psychologically unstable, as minds seek answers. When someone claims to hold no views, their skepticism is how they hide their views from themselves. ",
  "mn74:2.7": "",
  "mn74:9.2": "For _kāyanvayatā_ (“subservience to the body”) see [mn36:4.4](). The inclusion of this rare phrase here suggests that Jain-like practices such as starvation may be indicated. ",
  "mn74:13.1": "See [dn9:53.5](). ",
  "mn74:14.4": "Sāriputta became a stream-enterer on hearing a short teaching from the monk Assaji ([pli-tv-kd1:23.5.6]()), whereupon he told his friend Moggallāna. They both promptly left their former teacher Sañjaya, a traumatic loss to Sañjaya and his community. [an4.172:2.1]() says that Sāriputta became enlightened a fortnight after he ordained, a detail confirmed in multiple parallels to this passage; [mn111:2.8]() details the practice he undertook in that fortnight. This means that the current discussion must have taken place only a fortnight after leaving Sañjaya. Now, Sañjaya’s philosophy was to systematically avoid taking any position ([dn2:32.2]()), which is similar to Dīghanakha’s doctrine. It seems likely, then, that Dīghanakha was a disciple of Sañjaya. This supposition finds support in several parallels, which say Dīghanakha was annoyed to learn that Sāriputta had rejected other teachers and gone over to the Buddha (eg. Avadānaśataka, Vaidya 1958a 256: _sarve tīrthakarā nigṛhītāḥ_; also in Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra and Mahāvibhāṣā). These sources do not specify Sañjaya, but who else could it be? ",
  "mn74:16.4": "The Pali is alone in saying Dīghanakha became a lay follower, as all parallels report that he ordained and became an arahant. As with Vacchagotta at [mn72:22.2](), it is unlikely that a wanderer would become a lay follower and the Pali is probably in error. | The Mahāprajñāpāramitā-upadeśa-śāstra, Tibetan Mūla-Sarvāstivāda-Vinaya, and Avadānaśataka say that, having cut his long nails before ordination, he was known by his actual name, Koṣṭhila, that is, the monk known in Pali as Mahākoṭṭhita. This contradicts the Pali tradition, but as Anālayo shows, there are several inconsistencies in the Pali accounts, so the northern tradition is credible (*Comparative Study*, vol. 1, p. 406, note 88).
