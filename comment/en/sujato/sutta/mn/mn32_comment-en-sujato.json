  "mn32:1.2": "From [mn31:3.1]() we know that this park was near Ñātika in the Vajjian country. ",
  "mn32:4.7": "Ānanda was renowned as the most learned monk in the Sangha ([an1.219]()). ",
  "mn32:4.8": "Typically inclusive, Ānanda mentions the four assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. ",
  "mn32:5.6": "There were two prominent Revatas in the early Sangha. There was Revata of the Acacia Wood, who was said to be the foremost of forest dwellers ([an1.203]()); [thag14.1](), [thag1.42]()). But this is probably Revata the Doubter, who was the most skilled in _jhāna_ ([an1.204](); [thag1.3]()). Early in his monastic life he struggled with doubt over small maters ([pli-tv-kd6:16.1.1]()). He overcame this ([ud5.7]()), but the name stuck. ",
  "mn32:6.6": "Anuruddha is identified as foremost in clairvoyance at [an1.192](). | The verb _voloketi_ (“surveys”) is an elevated usage, only used of Anuruddha’s ability (see [an3.130:2.2]()) and when describing a Buddha “surveying” the world ([mn26:21.1]()). ",
  "mn32:6.7": "This power is compared (in the Majjhima) with a man standing between two doors watching people come to and fro ([mn39:20.3](), [mn77:35.2](), [mn130:2.1]()), and (in the Dīgha) with someone in a longhouse watching people move about in the town square ([dn2:96.1](), [dn10:2.33.1]()). The unique phrasing here evokes the Wheel that manifests to a Wheel-Turning Monarch as he stands upstairs in the royal longhouse, which is thousand-spoked and complete with rim (_sahassāraṁ sanemikaṁ_, [mn129:34.2](), [dn26:4.9]()). The simile was evidently unclear to the ancients, as one Chinese parallel has instead “a thousand bricks” (presumably laid out to dry in the sun, MA 184 at T i 727b14). In the Pali tradition, _nemimaṇḍala_ is the outer cladding of a wheel rim, often iron (see commentary to [ja475]()). However, normally sutta similes draw directly from experience, and it is hard to imagine how one would survey a thousand wheel rims (unless perhaps a king overseeing chariot construction in his forecourt?) On the other hand, the Wheel is a solar symbol and _nemimaṇḍala_ could easily refer to the orbits of the stars, which would explain “looking at the sky” of EA 37.3 ( at T ii 711a3). On balance, I think the simile refers to a star-gazing king. ",
  "mn32:7.6": "Mahākassapa’s austere lifestyle was renowned ([an1.191]()). ",
  "mn32:8.6": "In the suttas, _abhidhamma_ means “about the teaching” just as _abhivinaya_ means “about the Vinaya” (eg. [an3.140:4.4]()). Here the prefix _abhi-_ conveys the same sense as the English “meta-”. | This is a surprising topic for Moggallāna, and all three Chinese parallels as well as Sanskrit fragments say Moggallāna praised psychic powers, in which he was the recognized expert ([an1.190]()). It seems certain the Pali is corrupt here, and MA 185 more plausibly attributes discussion on the teaching to Mahākaccāna. ",
  "mn32:9.6": "While one might expect Sāriputta to praise wisdom, all the parallels agree on this point. Indeed, Sāriputta also speaks in a similar way on mental mastery at [sn46.4](). ",
  "mn32:17.3": "The Buddha gives positive reinforcement, not only to the wholesome qualities of others, but to the fact that they appreciate their own good qualities. This is not conceit, but a form of rejoicing (_muditā_). ",
  "mn32:17.5": "While the others spoke of results, the Buddha speaks of causes. Compare [mn123:22.1](), where the Buddha similarly brings the conversation back to meditation practice. "
