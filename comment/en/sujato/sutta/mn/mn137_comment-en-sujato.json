  "mn137:2.1": "Here and at [mn139:2.1]() the Buddha only announces that he will teach the analysis, but proceeds to give the recitation passage as well. Contrast with [mn133:6.2]() and [mn138:4.2](). ",
  "mn137:8.1": "Also at [mn140:10.1]() and [an3.61:12.1](). Outside of this context, _upavicāra_ is only found in [an6.52](), where women are “preoccupied” with adornments and thieves are “preoccupied” with a hiding place. ",
  "mn137:13.1": "",
  "mn137:13.3": "Also at [mn44:28.6](). That “dimension” (_āyatana_) is Nibbana ([ud8.1:3.1](), [sn35.117:8.2]()). ",
  "mn137:21.1": "The text has a unique teaching of three _satipaṭṭhānas_ (“establishments of mindfulness”). ",
  "mn137:22.4": "In the Pali manuscripts and commentary, the Burmese manuscripts appear to be alone in having the negative form _anattamana_ (“unhappy”). The Chinese parallel, however, supports the negative form (MA 163 at T i 693c29). | The commentarial derivation of _attamana_ as “self-mind” (= _sakamana_, “own-mind”) is unsatisfactory. Read with Sanskrit _āttamanas_ or _ādattamanas_ (“uplifted mind”, “smiling mind”). ",
  "mn137:25.3": "It seems that the text is punning _sārita_ (“driving”) with _sārathi_ (“charioteer”). ",
