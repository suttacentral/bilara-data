  "mn133:1.2": "The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57]()). They are still in use and just as popular as ever. ",
  "mn133:1.3": "Soon after he went forth, a deity in the same location tempted Samiddhi to enjoy sensual delights ([sn1.20]()). Had he succumbed, that would have been a case of “faltering amid presently arisen phenomena”. Samiddhi further appears in discourses at [mn136](), where he had gone forth only three years, and [an9.14 ](), where he seems more mature. In [sn4.22](), Māra threatens to shake his faith, prompting him to ask the Buddha about Māra’s true nature ([sn35.65]()). This event is recalled in his verse at [thag1.46](). ",

Contrast the situation at [mn137:2.1]() and [mn139:2.1](). ",

  "mn133:17.9": "_Dhamma_ is rendered here with “ideas”, namely those things which are known by the mind. Where it is rendered “phenomena”, it includes the “ideas” as well as all else that is known. "
