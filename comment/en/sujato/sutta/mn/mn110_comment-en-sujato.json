  "mn110:4.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhatti</i> is given in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga as a synonym of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sevanā</i>, “association” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/vb17/en/sujato#93.2'>Vb 17:93.2</a>). While this is correct, the early Pali contexts are more warmly emotional than the rather austere “association”, connecting it with words such as “faith” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saddhā</i>) and “fondness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pema</i>) (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag5.12/en/sujato#1.3'>Thag 5.12:1.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1/en/sujato#14.1'>Thig 15.1:14.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.141/en/sujato#5.2'>AN 5.141:5.2</a>).
