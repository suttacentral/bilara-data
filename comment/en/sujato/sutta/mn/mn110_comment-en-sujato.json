  "mn110:3.1": "Vassakāra asks the Buddha the same questions at [an4.187:2.1](), with an interesting example given from the court gossip. ",
  "mn110:4.1": "_Bhatti_ is given in the Abhidhamma Vibhaṅga as a synonym of _sevanā_, “association” ([vb17:93.2]()). While this is correct, the early Pali contexts are more warmly emotional than the rather austere “association”, connecting it with words such as “faith” (_saddhā_) and “fondness” (_pema_) ([thag5.12:1.3](), [thig15.1:14.1](), [an5.141:5.2]()). This anticipates the later use of _bhakti_ as “(ecstatic religious) devotion”. | “Devotion to untrue persons” is said to be a quality of the Jains ([an10.78:1.7]()). ",
  "mn110:6.2": "Where _assaddhamma_ appears in [an10.62:3.1](), it means listening to “untrue teachings”, whereas here it means “bad qualities”. ",
  "mn110:12.1": "Also at [an5.147](); see too [an9.20](). ",
  "mn110:13.4": "At [an2.26]()–29 these destinies are said to await one who hides misdeeds, who has wrong view, and who is unethical. At [mn97:30.3]() it is said that, of the two, the animal realm is better. "
