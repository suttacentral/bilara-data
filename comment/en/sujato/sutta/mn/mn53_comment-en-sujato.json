  "mn53:25.2": "Sanaṅkumāra (“Everyoung”) became a Hindu deity closely associated with the worship of Krishna. He first appears in the seventh chapter of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. The occasion he spoke this verse is recorded at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.11/en/sujato'>SN 6.11</a>, and it is repeated several times in the suttas, for example at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.28.2'>DN 3:1.28.2</a>, where it has a better contextual justification.
