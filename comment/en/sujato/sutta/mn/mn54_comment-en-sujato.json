  "mn54:15.1": "This list of similes is also found at [mn22:3.8](), [an5.76:11.2](), and [thig16.1:41.1](), as well as in various parallels to these texts. There, the list is expanded from seven to ten (with minor variations in parallels), and it is quoted as a familiar teaching without any need for explanation. This suggests that the list of similes first appeared here. ",
  "mn54:16.1": "In the similar passage at SN 19, we find kāka, crow, instead of kaṅka, heron. Given the behavior described here, I think it’s likely the original was, in fact, crow. The Chinese parallel at MN 203 does indeed have 烏, crow, here. Comm. is silent. ",
  "mn54:16.2": "The verbs here are uncertain, and readings vary considerably, both here and in the other occurence in SN 19. Here the comm. glosses clearly in the sense of “pecking and clawing” and I think it’s best to just stick to that. Compare Rig Veda 6.46.14, competing “like birds over raw flesh”. ",
