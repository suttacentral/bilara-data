These are evidently similar to the monastic _antaravāsaka_ and _saṅghāṭi_. | Parasols and sandals were considered inappropriate luxuries for monastics ([pli-tv-bi-vb-pc84](), [pli-tv-kd15:23.2.19](), [pli-tv-kd5:12.1.5]()), and it was considered disrespectful to teach someone thus attired ([pli-tv-bu-vb-sk57](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-sk62]()). There was, however, an exemption in all cases for health reasons, and monastics were allowed sandals outside of a village. ",
  "mn54:3.10": "Monastics were criticized as being “just like householders” for wearing sandals ([pli-tv-kd5:12.1.3]()) and sunshades ([pli-tv-kd15:23.2.8](), [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc8]()). ",

  "mn54:3.18": "The Buddha appears to be breaking his own rule against teaching someone with sandals and parasol. The Chinese parallel avoids this awkward situation by saying that Potaliya had set aside his parasol and sandals (MA 203 at T i 773a29). ",
  "mn54:4.2": "While all these items are standard, this list of eight does not appear elsewhere. It must have been a personal teaching for Potaliya. ",

There, the list is expanded from seven to ten (with minor variations in parallels), and it is quoted as a familiar teaching without any need for explanation. Several of the similes require explanation to make sense; for example “fruit on a tree”, by itself, hardly evokes suffering. Note too that the explanation below at [mn54:20.2]() mentions the town of Āpaṇa where the discourse is set.
