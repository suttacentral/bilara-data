  "mn80:2.1": "In later Brahmanical tradition the _vaikhānasa_ are a lineage descended from the sage Vikhānasa, and sometimes said to be the third stage of a brahmin’s life. ",
  "mn80:13.2": "I suspect this passage is corrupt. BB’s translation is not adequate. I have translated this with reference to the gava khiram passage found at AN 5.181, etc., which is syntactically very close.

The repeated statement, to my mind, suggests that Vekhanasa wants to confirm that the Buddha’s postulate is true, which is why the Buddha questions his competence. "
