  "mn147:1.4": "Five perceptions that ripen in freedom are taught at [dn33:2.1.139](), but apart from that we do not encounter this idea in the discourses. | In [sn18.1]()–5, Rāhula requests a teaching so he can go on retreat. The teachings given there can be compared with the parallel, which says the Buddha first told Rāhula to teach the five aggregates, the six sense-spheres, and conditionality, and then to go on retreat and meditate on the same teachings (SA 200 at T ii 51a23). Only then did the Buddha consider him ready. ",

  "mn147:2.1": "The presence of a thousand deities, which is unique to this discourse, is not mentioned in the parallel at all, and is obviously a later addition. "
