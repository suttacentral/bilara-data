  "mn33:2.1": "Since organizing teachings by number is the hallmark of the Aṅguttara Nikāya, it comes as no surprise to see this pattern repeated in the Book of the Elevens at [an11.17](), [an11.22-29](), and [an11.502-981](). ",
  "mn33:2.3": "“Knowing form” (_rūpaññū _) means being able to keep track of the herd by reckoning or recognizing them. A better translation would be “appearance”, but I use “form” for consistency. | “Ford” (_tittha_) is a way across the river. | “Spreads smoke” (_dhūmaṁ kattā_) is the traditional practice of warding off flies and other  pests by burning cow dung, etc. | “Satisfy” (_pīta_) is less literal than “drink”, but clarifies the simile later on. ",
  "mn33:9.1": "A _tittha_ (“ford”) is a path to salvation, usually used of non-Buddhist religions, whose founders are “ford-makers” (_titthakāra_). ",
  "mn33:9.2": "“Inheritors of the heritage” is _āgatāgamā_, where _āgama_ means “what has come down”, namely the scriptural heritage. _Āgama_ is a synonym for _nikāya_ in the sense of “collection of scripture”. | The “outlines” (_mātikā_, literally “matrix”) are the summary outlines of topics that served as seeds for the development of Abhidhamma. [dn16:3.50.5]() features one of the earliest of such lists, the 37 path factors that the Buddha “taught from his own direct knowledge”. These serve as outline for the section on the path in the Saṁyutta, from where they were adopted in various Abhidhamma texts such as the Vibhaṅga. ",
  "mn33:10.2": "This plays on the similarity of _pīta_ (“to have drunk, to have found satisfaction”) and _pīti_ (“rapture, joy”); see also [snp2.3:5.1](). ",
