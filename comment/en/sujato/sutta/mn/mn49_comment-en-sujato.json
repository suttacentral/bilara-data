  "mn49:1.1": "This sutta is a unique fusion of high philosophy and cosmic drama, positing an unthinkable alliance between what in Christian terms would be called God and the Devil. Nonetheless, due to a plethora of textual difficulties and uncertain readings, caution in interpretation would be wise. ",
  "mn49:2.1": "The same setting as [mn1](), with which this sutta shares some themes. Both critique the sophisticated philosophy of the Kosalan brahmins, and hence are set in the town of their leader Pokkharasāti ([dn3:1.2.1]()). ",
  "mn49:2.2": "Baka maintains the same wrong view at [sn6.4](), where his past lives are revealed. In neither sutta is he said to go for refuge, although SN 6.4 does end with effusive praise of the Buddha. The word _baka_ means “stork” or “crane”. To search for a high divinity of this name in Brahmanism is to be disappointed, for instead we find a man-eating demon (_rakṣasa_) in bird form whose fate is to be slain by the hero Bhīma (or Kṛṣṇa). Pali stories ([ja38](), [ja236]()) tell of how the stork dozes peacefully as if meditating by the water, while in reality he is trying to fool fish into approaching so he can snatch them up. A cunning, large, white, high-flying, predatory bird who fakes meditation is a fitting image for the antagonist of this sutta. ",
  "mn49:2.3": "The use of the impersonal pronoun (_idaṁ_) to refer to the self as divinity is a characteristic Upaniṣadic idiom: “you are that” (_tat tvam asi_, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7); “that self is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma_, Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 1.2); “I am that” (_so’ham asmi_, Īśa Upaniṣad 16); “this is that self hidden in all” (_eṣa ta ātmā sarvāntaraḥ_, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.4.1, etc.). | For _idaṁ niccaṁ_ see _eṣa nityo_ (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.23); for _idaṁ dhuvaṁ_ see _etad apramayaṁ dhruvam_ (4.4.20). ",
  "mn49:3.5": "The vocative _mārisa_ (possibly equivalent to _mādisa_, “one like me”), is used by the gods in Buddhist texts. ",
  "mn49:5.2": "Māra adopts the boast of Brahmā ([dn1:2.5.2]()). | It is rare for the Buddha to be addressed as “mendicant” (_bhikkhu_) and it is probably meant in a slighting sense. ",
  "mn49:5.3": "This is a summary of the items in [mn1](). | The “ascetics and brahmins” referred to here would include the ancient practitioners of movements such as Jainism, whose rejection of Vedism predates the Buddha. ",
  "mn49:5.4": "“With breath cut off” (_pāṇupacchedā_) is a unique idiom for death in Pali, but compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.14: _prāṇaṁ na vicchindyāt_; Atharvaveda 19.58.1c: _prāṇo’chinno_. ",
  "mn49:5.5": "This would be the ancient sages revered in the Vedic tradition. ",
  "mn49:5.9": "“Lady Luck” is Siri, later famed as goddess of fortune and prosperity. The same idiom recurs at [thag8.3:2.1](). As to why someone would ward her off, Siri (Sanskrit _śrī_) is identified with Lakṣmī, and it is under that name that she makes what may well be her first appearance. Atharva Veda 7.115 opens with, “Fly away wicked Lakṣmī, vanish, fly hence”. Apparently 101 Lakṣmīs attach to a man when born, and the spell chases away the wicked (_pāpi_) while keeping the good (_puṇya_). In this case the Pali text does not draw directly from the Veda, as there is no close verbal parallel, and the Pali presents as irrational an action that makes good sense in the context of the Vedic passage. Rather, it would seem, the Pali draws from a more general cultural awareness. | For “falling over a cliff” see [dn12:78.2](). ",
  "mn49:6.5": "Normally Māra is believed to hold sway over all the sensual realms, while the _jhānas_ (and their corresponding planes of rebirth) are beyond him ([mn25:12.1]()). Here his reach goes even further, as even the Brahmā realms, while freed from sensuality, are not freed from the attachment to continued existence. ",
  "mn49:7.2": "One of Māra’s talents is making people believe that his malign ideas are in fact their own. ",
  "mn49:7.5": "Note the use of _kasiṇa_ in the sense “entire”. ",
  "mn49:8.9": "The measuring of a Brahmā by their “light” (_juti_) shows the close connection between divinity and the stars. ",
  "mn49:10.1": "MS reads _añño kāyo_ (“another realm”), but the PTS and BJT reading _aññe tayo kāyā_ is supported by the Chinese parallel (MA 78 at T i 548a28). Possibly this change was necessitated by the addition of a fourth realm below. ",
  "mn49:10.2": "PTS and BJT have _tyāhaṁ_ (= _te ahaṁ_), consistent with their plural reading, as opposed to MS’s singular _tamahaṁ_. This shows that this variation, which is not decided by the commentary, was a deliberate editorial choice. ",
  "mn49:10.3": "Here _ābhassarā_ is masculine plural, hence not an adjective of _kāyo_ but a reference to the “gods” of that realm. MS is inconsistent in this point, for below we find _subhakiṇho_ and_vehapphalo_ as singular adjectives, where PTS and BJT consistently use the plural form. ",
  "mn49:10.4": "Brahmā also forgets his origins at [dn1:2.2.1](). ",
  "mn49:10.8": "MS adds a fourth class here, _abhibhū_ (“the Vanquisher”), which is not supported by PTS or BJT, or the Chinese parallel. ",
  "mn49:11.1": "This difficult passage directly echoes [mn1:3.3](). | _Anubhūta_ has its normal sense of “experiences”, “undergoes” ([thig10.1:8.2](), more commonly _paccanubhūta_, eg. [mn79:8.1](), [sn15.1:1.14]()). Commentary has _appattaṁ_, “not attained” (i.e. not within the scope of absorption). | That which “falls within the scope of experience characterized by earth” (_yāvatā pathaviyā pathavattena ananubhūtaṁ_) is sense experience and the four absorptions; that which does not fall in such a scope are the formless attainments and especially Nibbana. | For _nāhosiṁ_ (prefer over MS _nāpahosiṁ_) the commentary glosses “grasps”. The sense is that he does not identify. | For _abhivadati_, compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.14, which says that so long as there is the appearance of duality, one sees, hears, smells, “speaks about” (_abhivadati_), “conceives” (_manute_), and “cognizes” (_vijānāti_) particulars. Notice that this employs _abhivadati_ alongside _manute_, just as _abhivadati_ in the Pali appears alongside where _maññati_ appears in [mn1:3.3](). ",
  "mn49:23.1": "This whole passage seems designed to culminate with “experience characterized by all” (_sabbassa sabbattena ananubhūtaṁ_) in answer to Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.19, which says that “this self that experiences all is divinity” (_ayam ātmā brahma sarvānubhūḥ_). In surpassing even the “experience of all” the Buddha unequivocally asserts his superiority to the Upaniṣadic teaching. ",
  "mn49:24.1": "The close _-ti_ in MS edition indicates the end of Baka’s speech, but this is not found in PTS or BJT editions. If the close _-ti_ is accepted here, then the next paragraph is spoken by the Buddha and it should also end with close _-ti_, but no edition has this. We would also expect the Buddha to use a vocative, but there is none. The only reading that is both coherent and attested is that Baka’s speech begins here and ends when he says he will vanish. This is supported by the Chinese parallel, which while lacking an exact equivalent, attributes a similar claim to Brahmā (MA 78 at T i 548b11). ",
  "mn49:25.1": "These two lines are a fragment of verse found in full at [dn11:85.18](). Baka is asserting that what the Buddha has described is none other than the domain of “infinite consciousness”, which is one of the highest attainments attributed to Brahmanical sages. | “Where nothing appears” (_anidassanaṁ_) here is a synonym for “formless” (see eg. [mn21:14.8](), “space is formless and invisible”, _ākāso arūpī anidassano_). Normally the colors and images seen in the “form” absorptions are described as “visible” (eg. [dn16:3.29.1]()), so this indicates the formless attainments. ",
  "mn49:26.4": "Since he believes the dimension of infinite consciousness is that which the Buddha speaks of, he mistakenly assumes he has the power. ",
  "mn49:26.9": "This is a dramatic expression of the philosophical gulf between the Buddha and Baka. Baka’s power manifests as “light”, whereas the Buddha demonstrates invisibility. ",
  "mn49:27.1": "The Buddha shifts the focus from the attainment of a state of exalted consciousness to the cessation of existence. ",
  "mn49:27.2": "Following Bodhi and Critical Pali Dictionary in reading _vibhavesi_. | The _ca_ here answers to the last line of the verse. ",
  "mn49:29.2": "The verb _upanesi_ here is used above at [mn49:5.12]() in the opposite case, where Māra “presents” Brahmā’s assembly to the Buddha. "
