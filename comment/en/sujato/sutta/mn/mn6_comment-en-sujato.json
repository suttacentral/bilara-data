  "mn6:2.1": "The “monastic code” (_pātimokkha_) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. There are many extant _pātimokkhas_ in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit from early Buddhist schools, all similar but with some variations especially in minor rules of etiquette. Each fortnight the _pātimokkha_ is recited to affirm the communal values of the Saṅgha. Other passages are recited as inspiration, including this exhortation to keep the rules (also at [an4.12:1.1](), [an10.71:2.1](), and [iti111:2.1]()), as well as the verses known as _Ovāda Pātimokkha_ ([dn14:3.28.1]()). | Commentaries offer several explanations for the word _pātimokkha_, favoring the sense “leading to release” (from remorse and suffering). The Buddha says he laid down the _pātimokkha_ to tie the community together like flowers bunched with string ([pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.6]()), which suggests a connection with _paṭimukka_, “binding” ([mn38:41.11]()). ",
  "mn6:3.1": "To “fulfill precepts” repeats the commitment to the monastic code. | “Serenity” and “absorption” are the practice of meditation to develop tranquility (_samatha_). |  “Discernment” is _vipassanā_ (“insight”) meditation | “Empty huts” indicates solitude. ",
  "mn6:4.1": "This series of arguments is conditional: *if* this is what you want, *then* this is how to get it. The Buddha is not encouraging people to want these things; on the contrary, he frequently warned of the dangers of such attachments. He is being pragmatic: given that people have desires, how can they be encouraged to desire something better? "
