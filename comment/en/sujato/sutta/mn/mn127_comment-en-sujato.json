  "mn127:2.6": "BB has “punctually”, but _pageva_ usually means “how much more so”, and this sense is reinforced by _tara_. ",
  "mn127:2.7": "This whole passage, with Pancakanga addressing a man in the way of nobility, inviting a specific senior monk for a luxury spread, and working for the king, shows that “carpenter” is really quite inadequate. The root is _stha-pati_, i.e. master-builder. ",
  "mn127:13.1": "BB follows the PTS reading _abhiya_, but  Malalasekera says in the *Dictionary of Pali Proper Names* that this is likely to be the same person as the Sabhiya Kaccāna at [sn44.1](). Since this reading is found in the MS edition I adopt it here. ",
  "mn127:13.5": "BB has “By reason of the factor [responsible for rebirth]” for tadangena, but it is an idiom that appears in AN 9.33 without causal implication. If the answer was in terms of cause, the next question would not be necessary. "
