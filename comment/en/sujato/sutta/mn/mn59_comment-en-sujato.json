  "mn59:1.3": "Pañcakaṅga features as a prominent devotee of the Buddha in [mn78](), [mn127](), and in a parallel to the current sutta at [sn36.19](). As _thapati_ (“chamberlain”) he was the ranking official under Pasenadi. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.17–18 tells us that royal authority goes from the king, to the king’s brother, to the _thapati_, to the village head. Similarly, Atharva Veda 2.32.4a and 5.23.11a mention the _thapati_ directly after the king. [sn55.6:15.1]() shows the _thapati_ was trusted with the most intimate and sensitive duties of the court. Elsewhere we learn that they shared the meal and carriage with the king, accompanying him on military campaigns ([mn89:18.1]()), while [sn55.6:1.4]() shows them engaged in governing the provinces. Thus the _thapati_ was the highest non-royal official in the court, entrusted with governing, advising, and security of the household. | There are several individuals called Udāyī, and it is not possible to distinguish them all. ",
  "mn59:5.1": "The Buddha’s reply here develops the theme of “non-categorical” statements introduced in the previous sutta, showing that the same reality can be spoken of in many different ways. ",
  "mn59:5.2": "These are all explained in [sn36.22](). ",
  "mn59:7.3": "In discussing the path, the Buddha focuses on pleasure. ",
  "mn59:10.4": "This validates Pañcakaṅga’s view that neutral feeling can be reckoned as a subtle kind of pleasure. ",
  "mn59:15.6": "Since all feeling is conditioned, and what is conditioned is suffering, the cessation of feeling is reckoned as pleasurable. "
