  "mn70:2.1": "While I have not been able to trace a Jain rule regarding eating in the afternoon, not eating at night (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rattibhojanā</i>) was a standard practice of Jain ascetics (Uttarādhyayana 19.30, 13.2;  Dasaveyāliya 4.6, 6.26; Sūyagaḍa 1.2.3.3). It was adopted early into the Gradual Training (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn27/en/sujato#13.9'>MN 27:13.9</a>). The failure of mendicants to comply led to the laying down of a formal Vinaya rule (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/sujato'>Bu Pc 37</a>). But some came to regret their objections, recognizing that the Buddha had acted for their welfare (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn66/en/sujato#6.4'>MN 66:6.4</a>). | The related practice of eating in one sitting is, by contrast, not required in the Vinaya, but was encouraged (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#7.4'>MN 21:7.4</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn65/en/sujato#2.1'>MN 65:2.1</a>).

The arahant “freed both ways” is defined by their mastery of formless meditations, which they understand with wisdom (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn15/en/sujato#36.3'>DN 15:36.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.45/en/sujato'>AN 9.45</a>). | “Direct meditative experience” is an oblique rendering of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyena phusitvā</i>, since in the “formless” meditations, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> cannot mean “body”. Like other meditative terms, the sense of the word gradually grows more subtle as meditation deepens. In preliminary passages it simply means “the body” as contemplated in meditation. As meditation deepens it takes more of a sense of experience as it happens in the body. Finally, as physical perception fades, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> loses any sense of materiality and simply means direct personal experience of meditative states or even of Nibbana. ",
