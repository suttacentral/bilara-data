  "mn98:3.7": "Note that vrt and its derivates in Sanskrit don’t seem to have any special ritual meaning, but rather just behavior, work, actions, etc.",
  "mn98:8.27": "I think _yāna_ should be taken literally here as a chariot; consider the classic Indic imagery of flying chariots of the gods.",
  "mn98:9.12": "sambadha means the “groin”, i.e. the cramped area including the genital region, anus, etc. Methuna here must be specifrically the sexual organs.",
  "mn98:10.6": "_Sippa_ here is usually translated “craft”, but this refers primarily to occupations making things by hand. In DN 2 there is a long list of _sippa_, only a few of which are “crafts”. “Profession” fits better.",
  "mn98:10.30": "_Bhunjati_ at MN 98 must relate to the problematic _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ in MN 129, DN 17, and DN 26. Most translators there have, implausibly, “eat”. Here, Norman has “enjoy” while BB has “govern”. But the meaning probably is similar to the archaic English form “use”, in the legal sense of “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “don’t increase taxes”. That fits with the context, as this passage is all about ways people earn a living."
