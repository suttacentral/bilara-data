Some time later they must have sought the monkhood, as in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#1.3'>DN 27:1.3</a> they are living in the Sangha awaiting ordination. ",
  "mn98:3.4": "The ideal of brahminhood was a long-standing one, and so was the conflict over what exactly made someone a brahmin. Bhāradvāja expresses the most obvious and socially widespread understanding that it is simply a matter of birth. ",
  "mn98:3.7": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vattasampanno</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛttasaṁpanna</i>) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone who is “of good conduct, knows the law, and speaks the truth” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini</i>.

Mahābhārata 3.188.90b, 13.61.029a, Rāmāyaṇa 1.47.25c). | Compare the discussion at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#21.1'>DN 4:21.1</a>, where the Buddha leads Soṇadaṇḍa to agree that the essential qualities of a brahmin were ethical conduct and wisdom. ",
  "mn98:7.3": "Pokkharasāti’s conversion to Buddhism is recorded in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato'>DN 3</a>, which marks a turning point in the embracing of Buddhism by leading brahmins. The suttas of the Dīgha Nikāya that follow reverberate with the consequences of this encounter. He was one of the most influential brahmins of his time, although the Buddha elsewhere denied that he had any special knowledge (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#15.5'>MN 99:15.5</a>). Brahmanical texts know him as an influential teacher around the time of the Buddha; his name is spelled Pauṣkarasādi in Sanskrit. He is cited on grammar by Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and in the Taittirīya-prātiśākhya; on allowable food and theft in the Āpastamba Dharmasūtra; and on Vedic ritual in the Śāṅkhāyana-Āraṇyaka. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn99/en/sujato#10.3'>MN 99:10.3</a> clarifies that he is of the Upamañña lineage.

  "mn98:7.4": "In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. Bhāradvāja advocates his path at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#5.2'>DN 13:5.2</a> but without details. There is a Tārukṣya of Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1 whose view was that union (with Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other brahmins. In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa, the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows, thus locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa. ",
  "mn98:7.23": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viśvacakṣāḥ</i>, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).

  "mn98:11.6": "The Buddha categorically rejects Bhāradvāja’s genealogical understanding of a brahmin and endorses Vāseṭṭha’s understanding in terms of good conduct. Nonetheless, while a brahmin must have good conduct, the true meaning of the word lies in liberation and transcendence. In this, the Buddha’s position approaches that of Yājñavalkya, who argued that a brahmin, knowing the Self, gives up desire for sons, wealth, and heaven and wanders seeking alms (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.5.1); ultimately, only one who knows the imperishable is a brahmin (3.8.10).

However, this was the central topic of conversation between Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#3.1'>DN 13:3.1</a>, where they were concerned to distinguish one path as correct.

  "mn98:11.42": "A brahmin is identified with Mitra, the “friendly” god of alliances (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 4.1.4). The Brahmanical tradition endorses harmlessness except in the sacrifice (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.15.1), which can be read as either sheer hypocrisy or as a sacred and effective limitation on the scope of killing.
