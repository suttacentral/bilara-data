  "mn98:3.7": "Note that vrt and its derivates in Sanskrit don’t seem to have any special ritual meaning, but rather just behavior, work, actions, etc. ",
  "mn98:7.23": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (_viśvacakṣāḥ_, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14). See [dn16:5.6.3](). ",
  "mn98:8.27": "I think _yāna_ should be taken literally here as a chariot; consider the classic Indic imagery of flying chariots of the gods. ",
  "mn98:9.12": "sambadha means the “groin”, i.e. the cramped area including the genital region, anus, etc. Methuna here must be specifrically the sexual organs. ",
  "mn98:10.6": "_Sippa_ here is usually translated “craft”, but this refers primarily to occupations making things by hand. In DN 2 there is a long list of _sippa_, only a few of which are “crafts”. “Profession” fits better. ",
  "mn98:10.30": "Read _bhuñjati_ at [mn98:10.30]() with _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ at [dn17:1.9.4](), [dn26:6.7](), and [mn129:35.7](). Translators have rendered these with “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus _yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha_ means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. "
