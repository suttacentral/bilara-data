The Chinese parallel shares only the opening passages, after which it is quite different. Moreover, only three of the names are clearly the same: Ariṭṭha, Upariṭṭha, and Sudassana (EA 38.7 at T ii 723a–c). | Ñāṇamoḷī and Bodhi both rightly note that it is difficult to distinguish names from attributes without the commentary. Yet the commentary leaves many problems unsolved, as it omits many names. ",

Both are Buddhas in the sense of being awakened, but they differ in their relation to others. It is sometimes said that they do not teach, but the tradition attributes to them a number of sayings (notably <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.3/en/sujato'>Snp 1.3</a>). They are sometimes said to be “solitary”, but here 500 dwell on the same hill, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacceka</i> Brahmās appear in pairs (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn6.6/en/sujato#1.3'>SN 6.6:1.3</a>). Compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np9/en/sujato#1.36.1'>Bu NP 9:1.36.1</a>, where “independent” funds are set up for “independent” robes (rather than combining them); the same idea occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an11.16/en/sujato#11.2'>AN 11.16:11.2</a>. Likewise, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.37/en/sujato#1.7'>SN 1.37:1.7</a> speaks of “independent” verses. Thus the burden of sense in the Pali is that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pacceka</i> means “independent’, which here has the sense of not forming a fourfold community, but simply living and practicing independently. ",
  "mn116:3.6": "This etymology is a deliberate pun, since the obvious explanation would be that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gili</i> is simply <i lang='pi' translate='no'>giri</i> (“mountain”), as Pali <em>r</em> becomes <em>l</em> in the Magadhan dialect.

  "mn116:3.10": "I give the probable meaning of each name, and attempt, perhaps unwisely, to locate other sages of the past with similar names. In almost every case it is impossible to establish such links with any confidence, due to the lack of contextual details, the prevalence of common names used by many people, the use of names based on places or doctrinal concepts, and so on. Nonetheless, certain patterns emerge, especially the fact that several of the names seem to be shared with Jain <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tīrthaṅkaras</i>. These are the  twenty-four founding fathers of Jainism through the ages, like the Buddhist concept of past Buddhas. As many as eight names might be shared with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tīrthaṅkaras</i>, while several others might be other Jain sages. Even the name of the sutta itself is the name of a sage Isigiri in Isibhāsiyāiṁ 34.
