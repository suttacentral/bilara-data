  "thig16.1:16.4": "Note that ‘pabbajjā’ means ‘exile’. It is used for when a person is exiled as punishment for a crime. It is also used for ordination, because ordination is self-exile from ordinary society. ",
  "thig16.1:23.3": "I took this compound as ‘kheḷassa uccārassa va’. which is plausible. ‘kheḷa assu uccāra assava’, is also plausible. ",
  "thig16.1:45.3": "The original Pāli text reads ‘Gacchatha na me bhagavate’; accordingly, I translate ‘bhagavate’ as 'to the Buddha'. The reading ‘bhavagate’ is not in the root text; it is from the commentaries, which have not been used as the basis for this translation. ",
  "thig16.1:62.3": "'kāhinti' just means \"will do\" ",
  "thig16.1:62.4": "'sunakhaṁ' is accusative, different declension from 'chātā... caṇḍālā'. This leads me to believe that they are different things. Perhaps \"like hungry barbarians [attacking] a dog.\" Though as mentioned above, there is technically no word in the text that means \"attacking\". "
