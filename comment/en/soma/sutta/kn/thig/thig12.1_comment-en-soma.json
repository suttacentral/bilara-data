  "thig12.1:1.1": "I take this as the Brahmin speaking. The term ‘sīte’ appears to be locative. This could be locative of time, perhaps referring to when the weather is cold, not the water that she is collecting. In this case, this could be translated ‘I used to fetch water in the cold’ or something similar. That said, considering the context of the rest of this sutta, it appears to me that ‘udahārī’ here does not mean ‘water-carrier’ or ‘one who fetches water’ in the sense of a job that one does, but rather someone who is devoted to the religious practice of bathing in cold water. The literal meaning of ‘udahārī’ is ‘water-taker’, but that may be similar to how we say things like ‘Now I will take a shower’. So I take this line to mean ‘I am one who bathes in cold water.’ ",
