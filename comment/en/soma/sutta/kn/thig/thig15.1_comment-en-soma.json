  "thig15.1:10.1": "I recommend deleting the word \"well\". 'sannidhi' lit. means \"put down and together\" - ie, \"arranged\" or \"set out\". There is nothing that implies \"well\", and it also sounds weird in English.",
  "thig15.1:10.3": "'chādeti' usually means \"covers/conceals\" - perhaps similar to how someone will put a cloth or lid over food on a platter or in a pot when bringing it out to serve to others, then removes the covering at the last minute. So the meaning would be something like \"I covered, brought out, and gave to them whatever was proper.\" Alternately, 'chādeti' can also be causative of 'chandati' (\"desires, likes, is interested in\"), thus meaning \"causing another to desire, like, or be interested in something\" - but that meaning seems a bit odd in the sentence: \"I caused them to have desire, and I brought and gave to them what was proper\" - seems strange.",
