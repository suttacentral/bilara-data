  "thig15.1:43.3": "The term Mahilā only appears twice In the Pāli Canon. It has been translated as 'woman', from the similar Sanskrit word that has this meaning. I find this translation not in accordance with Dhamma.    \n\nIt seems more likely to me that this is a compound of the Pāli word ‘maha,’ worthiness, and the suffix -lā. This would indicate a lack of honor and respect, which would make more sense in text, given that it refers to a state of enslavement in this particular rebirth.\n",
