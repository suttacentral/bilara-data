Points then lost for translating 'saṅkhārā' as 'volitional formations' - I recommend just using 'formations', or if you want more, 'conditional formations.' It is dangerous to assume that 'saṅkhāra' is being used in a narrow sense when there is nothing in the text to indicate it is not being used in its broadest sense. *ALL* formations should be seen as alien and not-self, not only volitional formations ;)",
