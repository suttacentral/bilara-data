  "thig5.8:4.4": "'anupādāya' is probably instrumental or ablative - \"quenched because of not grasping\", or \"quenched by means of not grasping\" ",
  "thig5.8:5.3": "Technically there is no word 'body' in this phrase. Without any other context, I might render this phrase as \"Damn this contemptible decrepitude!\" But I think the intended meaning here is that she's indicating her triumph over birth-aging-death. The word \"atthu\" means \"let it exist\" - so perhaps she is saying \"Let there be this contemptible decrepitude\" - as in, \"Why would I care that there is decrepitude since I am awakened?\" "
