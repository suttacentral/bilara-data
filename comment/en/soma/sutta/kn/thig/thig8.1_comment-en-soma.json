  "thig8.1:1.3": "‘adhigacche’ is either optative (1st 2nd or 3rd person), or middle-voice 1st person. Given this ambiguity, it is hard to tell who is talking to who. Is this sentence someone talking to Sīsūpacālā about her, or is she talking about herself? Hard to tell. I suspect it is the latter, and that the following sentence about aspiring to Deva rebirth is spoken by Māra. "
