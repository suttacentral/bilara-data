  "pli-tv-pvr11:10.2": "(): _Kārakoti ekaṃ saṅghena saddhiṃ adhikaraṇaṃ vinicchinitvā pariveṇagataṃ parājitā bhikkhū vadanti ‘‘kissa, bhante, tumhehi evaṃ vinicchitaṃ adhikaraṇaṃ, nanu evaṃ vinicchinitabba’’nti. So ‘‘kasmā paṭhamaṃyeva evaṃ na vaditthā’’ti taṃ adhikaraṇaṃ ukkoṭeti. Evaṃ yo kārako ukkoṭeti_, “_Kārako_: having decided a legal issue together with the Sangha, he goes to the precincts, where the defeated monks say, ‘Venerable, why did you decide the legal issue in that way? Should it not be decided in this way?’ Saying, ‘Why did you not say this straightaway?’ he reopens that legal issue. In this way, the original doer reopens it.” ",
  "pli-tv-pvr11:32.1": "At first sight the Pali appears to be a straightforward declarative statement (“a legal issue arising from a dispute is a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business”), not a question. Yet this would man that the next sentence is a direct contradiction to present one, which dos not fit the context. The sub-commentary clears this is up by saying it is meant as a question. (): _Vivādādhikaraṇaṃ hoti anuvādādhikaraṇantiādīsu vivādādhikaraṇameva anuvādādhikaraṇādipi hotīti pucchāya vivādādhikaraṇaṃ vivādādhikaraṇameva hoti, anuvādādayo na hotīti vissajjanaṃ_, “About the phrase _vivādādhikaraṇaṃ hoti anuvādādhikaraṇan_, etc.: to the question whether a legal issue arising from a dispute is merely a legal issue arising from an accusation, the answer is that a legal issue arising from a dispute is merely a legal issue arising from a dispute, not a legal issue arising from an accusation.” "
