  "pli-tv-pvr5:152.8": "The punctuation of the Pali in this and the next two segments does not seem right. The purpose of this and the next three sentences is to answer the question posed just above about how the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from a dispute. For this to work, I propose the following punctuation: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vivādādhikaraṇe saṅgho vivadati vivādādhikaraṇaṁ. Vivadamāno anuvadati anuvādādhikaraṇaṁ. Anuvadamāno āpattiṁ āpajjati āpattādhikaraṇaṁ. Tāya āpattiyā saṅgho kammaṁ karoti kiccādhikaraṇaṁ.</i> This suggestion is supported by the punctuation found in the parallel passage at (pli-tv-pvr11:32.9-32.11). I translate accordingly. "
