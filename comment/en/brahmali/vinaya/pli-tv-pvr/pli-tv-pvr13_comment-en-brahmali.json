Evamettha yaṃ tena diṭṭhaṃ, taṃ tassa ‘‘diṭṭho mayā’’ti iminā diṭṭhavacanena sameti_, “The meaning of _diṭṭhaṃ diṭṭhena_ in the verse is this: a monk is seen emerging or entering a place alone with a woman, and one accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion, and the monk admits to what the other has seen. What was seen does not amount to an offense entailing expulsion, and he does not claim it. So in this case, what was seen by him agrees with his statement, ‘It was seen by me.’” ",

This is the way of knowing: ‘The accuser should say this first and that afterwards. The accused should say this first and that afterwards.’ This is to be known. The accuser is to be assessed, so is the accused and the investigator. If the investigator mangles (his speech) even a little, he should be told, ‘Reflect, fix it up, and then speak.’ This how the Sangha should act.” ",
