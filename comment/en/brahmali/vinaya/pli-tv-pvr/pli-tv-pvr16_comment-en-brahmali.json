The commentary explains this strange state of affairs as follows. Sp 5.404: _Katame dhammā anantarapaccayena paccayoti anāgatavasena anantarā hutvā katame dhammā paccayā hontīti attho_, “Which things are a condition as a proximity condition: which things are conditions of proximity by way of the future? This is the meaning.” In this way the ordinary conditioning relationship is inverted, that is, the condition is temporarily later than the outcome. We see the same pattern below.
