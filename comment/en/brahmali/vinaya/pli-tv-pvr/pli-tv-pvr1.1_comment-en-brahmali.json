It has come down for the nuns on account of the eight important principles. There are no other cases.” ",
  "pli-tv-pvr1.1:3.8": "Sp 5.2: _Dve anupaññattiyoti “antamaso tiracchānagatāyapī”ti ca, “sikkhaṁ apaccakkhāyā”ti ca makkaṭivajjiputtakavatthūnaṁ vasena vuttā – imā dve anupaññattiyo_, “Two _anupaññattiyo_ is said because of the accounts of the female monkey and the Vajjians.

This shows us that the prefix _abhi-_ means “about” in certain contexts, such as this one, and refers to a commentary style text. It may well be, then, that the Abhidamma, which is sometimes paired with _abhivinaya_ in the Canonical texts, originally was regarded as a commentary on content of the Sutta Piṭaka. ",
