  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.10": "The point here is that because Thullanandā (illegitimately) determines the robe-cloth as in-season, it can only be distributed to those nuns who have spent the rainy season in the monastery where the robe-cloth is given. The traveling nuns were therefore excluded from receiving it. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.6": "That is, in-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the last month of the rainy season, while out-of-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the remaining eleven months of the year. See the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī commentary. | According to the commentary to Bu Np 3, Sp 1.499: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kālepi ādissa dinnanti saṅghassa vā “idaṁ akālacīvara”nti uddisitvā dinnaṁ, ekapuggalassa vā “idaṁ tuyhaṁ dammī”ti dinnaṁ</i>, “‘Also, if it is given in the robe season, but it is designated’ means: it is given to the Sangha after designating it by saying, ‘This is out-of-season robe-cloth’, or it is given to an individual by saying, ‘I give this to you.’” In other words, it is designated as out-of-season cloth or designated to an individual. The commentary to the present rule, at Sp 2.740, adds that designating to a group is included in designated cloth: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ādissa dinnanti sampattā bhājentūti vatvāpi idaṁ gaṇassa idaṁ tumhākaṁ dammīti vatvā vā dātukamyatāya pādamūle ṭhapetvā vā dinnampi ādissa dinnaṁ nāma hoti; etaṁ sabbampi akālacīvaraṁ</i>, “‘Given after designating’ means: if they give after saying, ‘Let those who are present share it out’, or after saying, ‘I give this to the group, to you’, or they place it at the feet (of the recipient) wishing to give, this is called ‘Given after designating’. All this is called out-of-season robe-cloth.” "
