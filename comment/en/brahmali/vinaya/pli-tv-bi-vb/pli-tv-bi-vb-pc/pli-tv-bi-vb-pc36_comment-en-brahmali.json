  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:1.12": "The Pali has the singular _bhaginiyā_, “for a sister”, but I render it in the plural to fit better with English idiom. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:2.1.10": "For an explanation of these renderings, see Family Relationships in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:2.1.49": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65](), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
