  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc41:2.1.14": "The usual meaning of pokkharaṇī as “lotus pond” is well established in the suttas. Much of the time they seem to have been decorative, but there are few instances in the Vinaya where they are used for washing, such as in Mahakkhandhaka where the Buddha washes a cloth in a pokkharaṇī (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#20.1.4'>Kd 1:20.1.4</a>). In fact, this distinction in use is reflected in the commentaries, which speak of nahāna-pokkharaṇī, “pokkharaṇi for bathing”, and kīḷana-pokkharaṇi, “pokkharaṇi for playing”. Because pokkharaṇis were given to monasteries “for the benefit of the Sangha” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.1'>Kd 15:17.2.1</a>), they were probably meant for bathing and washing, not just for decoration. Moreover, it seems the pokkharaṇis could be quite elaborate structures with foundations, staircases, and rails (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.6'>Kd 15:17.2.1</a>). For these reasons I vary my translation according to context, sometimes using “pond”, at other times “tank”, and sometimes adding the qualifier “lotus”. "
