  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81:2.1.12": "The Pali just says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i>, without specifying that it is an <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti</i>, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali#2.65'>Bu Ss 10:2.65</a>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i>. The implication is that in these contexts <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
