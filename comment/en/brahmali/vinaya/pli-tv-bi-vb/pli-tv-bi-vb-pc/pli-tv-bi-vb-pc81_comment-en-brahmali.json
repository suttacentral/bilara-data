  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81:2.1.6": "In other words, consent is given for a specific meeting of the Sangha. When the meeting is over—that is, the gathering has left—the consent is no longer valid. See the discussion in Appendix II: Technical Discussion of Individual Bhikkhunī Rules. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81:2.1.12": "The Pali just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65](), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
