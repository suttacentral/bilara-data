  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:1.5": "“Bulb” renders _bhaṇḍika_. Normally I render this word as “bundle”, but here the intended meaning seems to be a “bundle” of cloves, that is, a single bulb of garlic. Sp 2.793: _Dve tayo bhaṇḍiketi dve vā tayo vā poṭṭalike; sampuṇṇamiñjānametaṁ adhivacanaṁ_, “Two or three _bhaṇḍika_: two or three bundles; this is an expression for being complete in cloves.” ",

Sp 2.797: Bhañjanako lohitavaṇṇo. … Miñjāya pana … bhañjanakassa dve, “The bhañjanaka is red. … But in regard to cloves … the bhañjanaka has two.” ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1:2.3.9": "“Sweets” renders _sāḷava_. SED, _sv_. _shāḍava_, says: “confectionery, sweetmeats”. "
