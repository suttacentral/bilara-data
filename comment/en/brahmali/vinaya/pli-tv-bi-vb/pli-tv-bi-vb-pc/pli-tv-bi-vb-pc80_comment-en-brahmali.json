  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:1.2": "According to DOP, the combination <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na</i> + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pi</i> should be understood as “nor”. In the present case the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na</i> is represented by the negation <i lang='pi' translate='no'>an</i> in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ananuññāta</i>. We then have a neither-nor sentence, which makes it fit with the rule below. Reading the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pi</i> as “and” creates a discrepancy with the rule. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:2.1.16": "The Pali just says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i>, without specifying that it is an <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti</i>, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali#2.65'>Bu Ss 10:2.65</a>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i>. The implication is that in these contexts <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
