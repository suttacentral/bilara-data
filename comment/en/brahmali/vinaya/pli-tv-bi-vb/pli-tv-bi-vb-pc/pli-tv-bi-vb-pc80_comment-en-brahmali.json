  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:1.2": "According to DOP, the combination _na_ + _pi_ should be understood as “nor”. In the present case the _na_ is represented by the negation _an_ in _ananuññāta_. We then have a neither-nor sentence, which makes it fit with the rule below. Reading the _pi_ as “and” creates a discrepancy with the rule. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:1.14.1": "It is often understood that a woman needs permission from both her parents and her husband to ordain as a _bhikkhunī_. Yet the rule uses the conjunction _vā_, which can only reasonably be rendered as “or”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:2.1.16": "The Pali just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65](), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
