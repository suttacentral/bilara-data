  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:1.20.1": "“Refuses an offer to eat more” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavārita</i>. I normally translate both <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nimantita</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavārita</i> as “invited”. Yet this becomes awkward on the rare occasions, such as here, when the two words occur together, and so in this instance I instead use the verb “offer” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavārita</i>. Moreover, in the present case, the contextual meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavārita</i> is that the nun has expressed her satisfaction after being invited to take more, thus my rendering. See the discussion of this rule in Appendix II: Technical Discussion of Individual Bhikkhunī Rules. For further discussion of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavārita</i>/<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavāraṇā</i>, see Appendix I: Technical Terms. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.2.1": "The non-offense clause below states that there is no offense if one has been invited but has not refused an offer to eat more. In other words, there is only an offense if both of these factors are fulfilled. I therefore take invited here to be a shorthand for invited plus refused an offer to eat more. ",
