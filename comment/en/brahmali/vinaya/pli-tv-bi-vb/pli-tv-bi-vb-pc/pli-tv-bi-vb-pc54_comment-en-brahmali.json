  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:1.20.1": "“Refuses an offer to eat more” renders _pavārita_. I normally translate both _nimantita_ and _pavārita_ as “invited”. Yet this becomes awkward on the rare occasions, such as here, when the two words occur together, and so in this instance I instead use the verb “offer” for _pavārita_. Moreover, in the present case, the contextual meaning of _pavārita_ (see below) is that the nun has expressed her satisfaction after being invited to take more, thus my rendering. See the discussion of this rule in the Appendix. For further discussion of _pavārita_/_pavāraṇā_, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.1.8": "As with [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:3.1.8]() and [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:2.1.10](), the punctuation of the Pali is wrong. An additional comma is required between _ṭhito_ and _abhiharati_. “They” refers to the donor, whether male or female. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54:2.2.1": "The non-offense clause below states that there is no offense if one has been invited but has not refused an offer to eat more. In other words, there is only an offense if both of these factors are fulfilled. I therefore take invited here to be a shorthand for invited plus refused an offer to eat more. ",
