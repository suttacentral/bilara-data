  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3:5.2.2": "[Sp.2.693]() defines _pakkhasaṅkantā_ as joining another religion: _Pakkhasaṅkantā vāti titthāyatanaṃ saṅkantā_, “_Pakkhasaṅkantā vā_ means one who has joined the ascetics of another religion.” Yet the idea of _pakkha_ also refers to groups or factions within the Sangha, for instance, when the Sangha is split into different communities (_nānāsaṁvāsa_) that no longer perform legal procedures together.
