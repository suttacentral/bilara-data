  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.10": "“Sibling” renders _bhātaro_, literally “brothers”. In the Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both genders. For instance, the plural of _putta_, literally “sons”, often means “children”. In the same way, the plural of _bhātā_ can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding nouns that normally refers to males is confirmed by the Pali lexical work called the Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā: _Ettha hi mātā ca pitā ca pitaro, putto ca dhītā ca puttā, sassu ca sasuro ca sasurā, bhātā ca bhaginī ca bhātaroti bhinnaliṅgānampi ekaseso dassitoti_, “‘Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” "
