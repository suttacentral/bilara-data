  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.10": "“Offspring” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>putta/ā</i>, whereas “sibling” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhātaro</i>. In the Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both sexes. For instance, the plural puttā, “sons”, may mean “children” or “offsping”, depending on the context. In the same way, the plural bhātāro, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding male-gender nouns is confirmed in the introduction to the Pali lexical work the Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ettha hi mātā ca pitā ca pitaro, putto ca dhītā ca puttā, sassu ca sasuro ca sasurā, bhātā ca bhaginī ca bhātaroti bhinnaliṅgānampi ekaseso dassitoti</i>, “Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” The Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā is available online at tipitaka.org.
