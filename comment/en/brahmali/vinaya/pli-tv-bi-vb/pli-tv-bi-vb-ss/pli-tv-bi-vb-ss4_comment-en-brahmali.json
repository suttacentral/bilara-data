Padabhājanaṁ panassa “yena dhammena yena vinayena ukkhitto suukkhitto hotī”ti imaṁadhippāyamattaṁ dassetuṁ vuttaṁ_, “_Dhammena_: according to truth, according to the rule. _Vinayena_: having accused, having reminded. But the word analysis is spoken to show just this meaning: ‘_Yena dhammena yena vinayena_ means ejected, properly ejected.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:2.1.18": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65](), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:2.3.5": "_Asanta_ can mean “non-existent”, but in this kind of context it often means “unavailable”. See for instance [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46:6.1.11](), [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:5.1.7]() and [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51:4.3.3](). "
