  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:2.1.20": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṁ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as in _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:2.3.5": "_Asanta_ can mean “non-existent”, but in this kind of context it often means “unavailable”. See for instance _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 46, _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 85, and _bhikkhunī-pācittiya_ 51. "
