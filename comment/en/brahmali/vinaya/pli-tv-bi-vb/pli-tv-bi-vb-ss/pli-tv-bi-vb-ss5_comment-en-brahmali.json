  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss5:2.2.2": "As with  [pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:2.2.15.1]() above, the Pali just says that, “One of them has lust”, _ekatoavassute_, without specifying who. In this rule, however, the non-offense clause specifically says that there is no offense if the nun knows that the man does not have lust, and so the state of mind of the nun does not seem to be an issue. It follows that “one of them has lust” must refer to the man. This understanding is supported by Sp 2.701: _Ekato avassuteti ettha “bhikkhuniyā avassutabhāvo daṭṭhabbo”ti mahāpaccariyaṁ vuttaṁ. Mahāaṭṭhakathāyaṁ panetaṁ na vuttaṁ, taṁ pāḷiyā sameti_, “‘One of them has lust’: In regard to this it is said in the Mahāpaccarī, ‘There being lust in the nun is to be understood.’ But this is not said in the Mahāaṭṭhakathā, and this agrees with the Canonical text.” "
