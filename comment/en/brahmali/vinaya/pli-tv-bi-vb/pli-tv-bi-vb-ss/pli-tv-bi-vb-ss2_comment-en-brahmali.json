  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.11": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Jānāhi</i>, literally, “You know.” The implied meaning is not clear. However, in commenting on a different passage, one of the sub-commentaries, Sp-ṭ 4.330, defines the word as follows: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Jānāhīti cettha paṭipajjāti attho veditabbo</i>, “And here the meaning of ‘you know’ is to be understood as ‘you undertake’.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.30": "The Pali just says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i>, without specifying that it is an <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti</i>, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali#2.65'>Bu Ss 10:2.65</a>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i>. The implication is that in these contexts <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
