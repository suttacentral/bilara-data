  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.11": "_Jānāhi_, lit. “You know.” The implied meaning is not clear. However, in commenting on a different passage, one of the sub-commentaries, [Sp-ṭ.3.330](), defines the word as follows: _Jānāhīti cettha paṭipajjāti attho veditabbo_, “And here the meaning of ‘you know’ is to be understood as ‘you undertake’.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:2.1.30": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṁ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as in _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
