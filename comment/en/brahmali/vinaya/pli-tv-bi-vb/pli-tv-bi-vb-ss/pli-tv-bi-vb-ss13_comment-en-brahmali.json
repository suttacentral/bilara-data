  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.5": "In the sequence <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uññāya paribhavena akkhantiyā vebhassiyā dubbalyā</i> every word seems to be in the instrumental case except <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dubbalyā</i>, which presumably is an ablative. This is unusual. The commentary, at Sp.2.727, says: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dubbalyāti tumhākaṃ dubbalabhāvena</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dubbalyā</i>: because of your weakness.” This implies that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dubbalyā</i> is the only word in the sequence that does not refer to the Sangha, but rather to the misbehaving nuns, which would be odd. Yet the commentarial interpretation is supported by the word commentary below, which defines <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dubbalyā</i> as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apakkhatā</i> , “because of lack of supporters”. I therefore feel compelled to follow the commentarial interpretation. ",

Yet just below the text says that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i>. The implication is that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. ",
