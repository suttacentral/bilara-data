  "pli-tv-kd18:4.1.30.0": "“Dining hall” renders _bhattagga_, lit. “eating house”. The name suggests that the _bhattagga_ was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries ([](pli-tv-kd10:4.5.7)). Since they were part of houses, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the _bhattagga_, except in monasteries. This is supported by a passage in _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 3 ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.1)) that mentions a cooking implement, a pestle, being stored in a _bhattagga_.",

  "pli-tv-kd18:7.4.18.0": "“Sauna” renders _jantāghara_. The Buddha’s personal physician, Jīvaka, recommended a _janṭāghara_ for the Sangha to keep the monks healthy ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.1.8)). The _jantāghara_ was a room with a fire place and a flue ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.16)). It was used to make one sweat ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.31)) and was also a place for cleaning oneself ([](pli-tv-kd1:25.12.4)). Moreover, the verb for what one does in a _jantāghara_ is “bathe”, _nahāyati_ ([]( pli-tv-kd20:27.4.15)). All in all it comes very close to what we now call a sauna.",

The conversion to metrical units is based on the following calculation. According to a report published by Imperial College London (http://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/173634/dutch-latvian-women-tallest-world-according/), the height of an average Indian man in 1914 was 162 centimeters. We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm.

  "pli-tv-kd18:11.16.4": "“Conduct himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vatteyya, lomaṃ pāteyya, netthāraṃ vatteyya_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult.
