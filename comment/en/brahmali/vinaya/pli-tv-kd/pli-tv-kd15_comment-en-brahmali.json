Commenting on _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya_ 26 [](Kkh-pṭ) says: _Vemanti vāyanūpakaraṇo eko daṇḍo, suttaṁ pavesetvā yena ākoṭento ghanabhāvaṁ sampādenti_, “_Vema_: a weaving instrument consisting of a single rod; having entered the thread, that by which they make it firm by knocking.” [Vmv.4.277]() clarifies that this concerns the cross-going thread, the weft: _Vāyantā tiriyaṁ suttaṁ pavesetvā_ …, “Those weaving, having entered the weft …” | _Kavaṭa_. I am unable to trace any exegetical information on this word; quite possibly the reading is corrupted. It may be that we should prefer the PTS reading of _vaṭa_, which can mean “string” or “tie” (see Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary ). Since the warp seems to be covered by _tantaka_, it does not seems unreasonable to suggest _vaṭa_ refers to the “weft”, that is, the cross-thread. | _Salāka_. The basic meaning of this word is “small stick”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka the word _salāka_ is used especially to designate the “voting tickets” that were sometimes used when making decisions in the monastic Sangha. The “shuttle” is a basic weaving equipment and its size would seem to fit well with the size of a _salāka_. However, since there is no exegetical information on this word used in this context, this is no more than a hypothesis.",
