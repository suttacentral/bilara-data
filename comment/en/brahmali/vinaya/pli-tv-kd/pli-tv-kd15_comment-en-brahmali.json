  "pli-tv-kd15:27.4.6": "My rendering is based on the reading _aḍḍhuraka_. Sp 4.275: _Aḍḍhadukanti udare lomarājiṭṭhapanaṁ_, “_Aḍḍhaduka_: arrangement of lines of hair on the stomach.” The problem with this is that it is difficult to see how this meaning bears any relationship with _aḍḍhaduka_. In fact, _aḍḍhaduka_ is a curious word. On the face of it, it should mean “half a dyad”, but this hardly makes much sense in the context. A major problem with _aḍḍhaduka_ is that the reading is highly uncertain. BJT gives the alternative _aḍḍhuraka_, SRT _aḍḍharuka_, and the PTS edition _aḍḍharūka_. The first of these is particularly interesting: it almost certainly means “half-chest-ed”. It could well be that this is the basis for the commentarial gloss. The actual commentarial reading (the lemma) may be due to a later “correction”, perhaps based on a change in the Canonical text. If we start with _aḍḍhuraka_ as the original form, it is relatively easy to explain the other two forms, which weighs in favor of this reading. _Aḍḍharuka_ can be explained as an _a/u_ metathesis in _aḍḍhuraka_, which is all too common in oral tradition, especially with obscure words. Once the meaning was lost, _aḍḍhaduka_ may have formed as a kind of further corruption, either by accident or through intentional “correction”. We would then see the following pattern of corruption: _aḍḍhuraka_ > _aḍḍharuka_ > _aḍḍhaduka_. ",

It is possible that _tantaka_ is merely another term for _tanta_ “a loom”. “Reed” renders _vema_. Commenting on Bu Np 26, Kkh-pṭ says: _Vemanti vāyanūpakaraṇo eko daṇḍo, suttaṁ pavesetvā yena ākoṭento ghanabhāvaṁ sampādenti_, “_Vema_: a weaving instrument consisting of a single rod; having entered the thread, that by which they make it firm by knocking.” Vmv 4.277 clarifies that this concerns the cross-going thread, the weft: _Vāyantā tiriyaṁ suttaṁ pavesetvā_ …, “Those weaving, having entered the weft …” According to SED, however, the _vema_ is the loom. “Weft” renders _kavaṭa_. I am unable to trace any exegetical information on this word; quite possibly the reading is corrupted. It may be that we should prefer the PTS reading of _vaṭa_, which can mean “string” or “tie”, according to SED. Since the warp seems to be covered by _tantaka_, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest _vaṭa_ refers to the “weft”, that is, the cross-thread. “Shuttle” renders _salāka_. The basic meaning of this word is “small stick”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka the word _salāka_ is used especially to designate the “voting tickets” that were sometimes used when making decisions in the monastic Sangha. The “shuttle” is a basic weaving equipment and its size would seem to fit well with the size of a _salāka_. However, since there is no exegetical information on this word used in this context, this is no more than a hypothesis. ",
