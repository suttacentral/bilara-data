Respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 _yojanas_ long. I normally take a _yojana_ to be approximately 13 kilometers, but here use 10 kilometers instead, so as to give round figures.

Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upeti_ means, when a legal procedure is being carried out by the Sangha, one who wishes to invalidate the procedure does not come (to the meeting), or does not give his consent, or objects in the presence (of the assembled Sangha). He commits wrong conduct. Thus, for him who has an offense, the Monastic Code is canceled.” [Vmv.4.387]() adds: _Dhammikaṁ sāmagginti dhammikaṁ samaggakammaṁ_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ_ means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent. In such a case you are allowed to cancel their hearing of the Monastic Code. | _Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ paccādiyati_.
