  "pli-tv-kd19:1.3.24": "Sea monsters is a combined rendering of the three terms _timi_, _timiṅgala_, and _timitimiṅgala_. They refer to enormous fish of different sizes. The creatures mentioned, the _attabhāvā_—which presumably include the sea monsters—have huge bodies, respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 _yojanas_ long. I normally take a _yojana_ to be approximately 13 kilometers, but here use 10 kilometers instead, so as to give round figures. See discussion of the _yojana_ under Measures in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.7": "The Pali just says _tassa pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapetuṁ_, “(I allow you) to cancel his Monastic Code”. I have added “hearing” for clarity. ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.83": "The point seems to be that it is illegitimate to cancel the Monastic Code of someone who is behaving appropriately, including taking part in legal procedures in the appropriate manner and not reopening legitimate legal procedures. See discussion in the next note. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.89": "[Sp.4.387](): _Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upetīti kammaṁ kopetukāmatāya saṅghassa kamme karīyamāne neva āgacchati, na chandaṁ deti, sammukhībhūtova paṭikkosati, tena dukkaṭaṁ āpajjati. Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upeti_ means, when a legal procedure is being carried out by the Sangha, one who wishes to invalidate the procedure does not come (to the meeting), or does not give their consent, or objects in the presence (of the assembled Sangha). They commit wrong conduct. Thus, because they have an offense, the Monastic Code gets canceled.” [Vmv.4.387]() adds: _Dhammikaṁ sāmagginti dhammikaṁ samaggakammaṁ_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ_ means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent. In such a case you are allowed to cancel their hearing of the Monastic Code. [Sp.4.387](): _Paccādiyatīti “puna kātabbaṁ kamma”nti paccādiyati, tena ukkoṭanakena pācittiyaṁ āpajjati. Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti_, “_Paccādiyati_ means saying, ‘The legal procedure needs to be redone.’ Because of that reopening, they commit an offense entailing confession.
