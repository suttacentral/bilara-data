They refer to enormous fish of different sizes. The creatures mentioned, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attabhāvā</i>—which presumably include the sea monsters—have huge bodies, respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yojanas</i> long. I normally take a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yojana</i> to be approximately 13 kilometers, but here use 10 kilometers instead, so as to give round figures.

  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.83": "The point seems to be that it is illegitimate to cancel the Monastic Code of someone who is behaving appropriately, including taking part in legal procedures in the appropriate manner and not reopening legitimate legal procedures. See discussion in the next note. ",

They commit wrong conduct. Thus, because they have an offense, the Monastic Code gets canceled.” Vmv 4.387 adds: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhammikaṁ sāmagginti dhammikaṁ samaggakammaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ</i> means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent.
