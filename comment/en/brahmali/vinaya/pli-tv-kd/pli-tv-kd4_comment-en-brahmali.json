[Sp.1.16](): _Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṁ hoti_, “The path is called the bridge; such speech is destroyed by the path.” The commentary seems to take _setu_, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access. ",
