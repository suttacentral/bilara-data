  "pli-tv-kd5:3.1.4": "I read _orohitvā_ with the PTS version, against _ārohitvā_ in MS. The MS text is saying that he is already wearing sandals, but then puts them on before going to meet the Buddha, which does not make good sense. ",

  "pli-tv-kd5:6.4.12": "The shoe, _pādukā_, is introduced in this section, as distinct from the _upāhanā_, “sandal”, of the previous sections. They are both footwear and the distinction between them is not obvious. The best indication as to the difference is found at Sp-yoj 1.638: _Pādukanti upāhanaviseso. So hi pajjate imāyāti pādukāti vuccati, sā bahupaṭalā cammamayā vā hoti kaṭṭhamayā vā_, “A _pāduka_: it is distinct from an _upāhana_. It is called a _pāduka_, because one should walk with it. It has much covering made of skin or wood.” Here the distinction between the two appears to hinge on the amount of covering, and thus translating the two terms as “shoe” and “sandal” seems justified. Moreover, the distinction made in BMC I, p. 444, and BMC II, chapter III, that _upāhāna_ refers to leather footwear whereas _pāduka_ refers to non-leather footwear is here contradicted: it is specifically stated that a _pāduka_ can be made of leather.

For the first four kinds of shoes I use the expression “made of”, but for the remainder, “made with”. It seems unlikely that the entire shoe would be made of these precious substances. ",
