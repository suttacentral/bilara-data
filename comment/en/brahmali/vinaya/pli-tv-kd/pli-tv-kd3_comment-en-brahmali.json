  "pli-tv-kd3:5.2.6": "The Pali word translated here as “give” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>patiṭṭhāpetu</i>, which normally means “establish”. In the present context I understand it as “establishing a gift”, in the sense that the gift is meant for the Sangha but given in the presence of the local monks. The expression <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dakkhiṇaṁ patiṭṭhāpeti</i>, “to establish a gift”, is quite common in the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>suttas</i>, see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.19/en/brahmali#3.2'>SN 3.19:3.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.61/en/brahmali#16.1'>AN 4.61:16.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.41/en/brahmali#5.1'>AN 5.41:5.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.227/en/brahmali#2.3'>AN 5.227:2.3</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.37/en/brahmali#1.2'>AN 6.37:1.2</a>.

  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.1": "As elsewhere, I have rendered <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> together as “stilt house”. According to the commentaries, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i>, are all different kinds of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. Sp 4.294: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ</i>, “An <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is a house bent like a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i>.” Sp-t 3.4.294 clarifies: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkageha</i>: a house made in the shape of the wings of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garula</i>.” A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḷa</i>, better known in its Sanskrit form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḍa</i>, is a mythological bird. Sp 4.294 continues: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva</i>, “A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> is a long stilt house. A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> is just a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-t 3.3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. See also <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt house”, in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",

Commenting on Bu Ss 13, Sp 1.435 explains: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātenti</i>: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na netthāraṁ vattanti</i>: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out (of the offense).” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.
