  "pli-tv-kd3:1.3.4": "_Vassaṁ upagantuṁ_, lit. “to enter the rainy season”, but the idea of staying put in one place is implied. In these cases _vassa_, “rainy season”, is used synonymously with _vassāvāsa_, “rainy-season residence” or “rains residence”.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:2.2.6": "Although the match is not precise, I have here translated Āsāḷha as July.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:3.2.4": "The Pali has ellipses points at the end of this sentence. This seems to be a mistake.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:4.3.4": "_Rājūnaṁ anuvattituṁ_, lit. “(You should) behave according to the kings.” This is often understood to mean that monastics are obliged to follow the laws of the land in which they live.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.2.6": "The Pali word translated here as “give” is _patiṭṭhāpetu_, which normally means “establish”. In the present context I understand it as “establishing a gift”, in the sense that the gift is meant for the Sangha but given in the presence of the local monks. The expression _dakkhiṇaṁ patiṭṭhāpeti_, “to establish a gift”, is quite common in the _suttas_, see [](sn3.19:3.2), [](an4.61:16.1), [](an5.41:5.1), [](an5.227:2.3), and [](an6.37:1.2).",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.1": "[See essay on _pāsāda_.] | As elsewhere, I have rendered _aḍḍhayoga_, _pāsāda_, and _hammiya_ together a “stilt house”. According to the commentaries, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. [Sp.4.294](): _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” [Sp-ṭ.3.4.294]() clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” [Sp.4.294]() continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At [Sp-ṭ.3.3.74](), however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.4": "[See essay on _guhā_.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.8": "“Water-boiling shed” renders _aggisālā_, lit. “fire shed”. The nature of the _aggisālā_ is not clear from the Canonical texts, the term being found almost exclusively in lists of buildings and stock passages. We need to turn to the commentaries for a description. [Sp.2.112](): _Ajjhokāse rajanaṁ pacitvā rajanabhājanaṁ rajanauḷuṅko rajanadoṇikāti sabbaṁ aggisālāya paṭisāmetabbaṁ_, “After boiling dye outside, the dye-vessel, the dye-ladle, and the dye-trough should all be put away in the _aggisālā_.” [Sp-yoj.1.112](): _Aggisālāyanti agginā pacanasālāyaṁ_, “_Aggisālā_: the shed for boiling with a fire.” This suggests that the purpose of this building was to boil water, one purpose of which was to dye cloth. Occasionally _aggisālā_ can also refer to a “fire hut”, as used by ascetics who tended the sacred fire. The latter half of the word, _sālā_, is often rendered as “hall”, but in some context, such as here, a humble structure is clearly intended. In fact _sālā_ seems to be a generic term for a building.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.15": "“Sauna” renders _jantāghara_. The Buddha’s personal physician, Jīvaka, recommended a _janṭāghara_ for the Sangha to keep the monks healthy ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.1.8)). The _jantāghara_ was a room with a fire place and a flue ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.16)). It was used to make one sweat ([](pli-tv-kd15:14.3.31)) and was also a place for cleaning oneself ([](pli-tv-kd1:25.12.4)). Moreover, the verb for what one does in a _jantāghara_ is “bathe”, _nahāyat_i ([]( pli-tv-kd20:27.4.15)). All in all it comes very close to what we now call a sauna.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.9.8": "According to the commentaries the _māḷa_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_ are all different kinds of stilt houses. It is hard to make a meaningful distinction between these buildings from a modern perspective, and I have there grouped them together into the single category of stilt house. See [Sp.1.482]() for further details.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.12.19": "According to the commentaries the _māḷa_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_ are all different kinds of stilt houses. It is hard to make a meaningful distinction between these buildings from a modern perspective, and I have there grouped them together into the single category of stilt house. See [Sp.1.482]() for further details.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:6.11.4": "“Conducts himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vattati, lomaṁ pāteti, netthāraṁ vattati_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult. Commenting on _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 13, [Sp.1.435]() explains: _Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti_, “_Na lomaṁ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṁ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:6.25.4": "_Vassaṁ pucchitukāmo_. _Vassa_ could here refer to rains/rainy season or to the year, i.e. the age of the novice, perhaps to find out out whether he is eligible for ordination. The commentaries are silent.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:7.8.2": "“One who is staying with monks” renders _bhikkhugatika_. [Sp.3.275](): _Bhikkhugatikoti ekasmiṁ vihāre bhikkhūhi saddhiṁ vasanakapuriso_, “_Bhikkhugatika_ means a man living with the monks in a particular monastery.”",
  "pli-tv-kd3:12.9.1": "_Cāṭi_. [Sp.3.204](): _Cāṭiyāti etthāpi mahantena kapallena_, “Here _cāṭi_ is a large bowl.”",
  "pli-tv-kd3:14.3.1": "The Pali has ellipses points at the end of this sentence. This seems to be a mistake."
