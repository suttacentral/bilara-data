  "pli-tv-kd3:1.3.4": "_Vassaṁ upagantuṁ_, lit. “to enter the rainy season”, but the idea of staying put in one place is implied. In these cases _vassa_, “rainy season”, is used synonymously with _vassāvāsa_, “rainy-season residence” or “rains residence”.",

  "pli-tv-kd3:4.3.4": "_Rājūnaṁ anuvattituṁ_, lit. “(You should) behave according to the kings.” This is often understood to mean that monastics are obliged to follow the laws of the land in which they live.",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.2.6": "The Pali word translated here as “give” is _patiṭṭhāpetu_, which normally means “establish”. In the present context I understand it as “establishing a gift”, in the sense that the gift is meant for the Sangha but given in the presence of the local monks. The expression _dakkhiṇaṁ patiṭṭhāpeti_, “to establish a gift”, is quite common in the _suttas_, see [](sn3.19:3.2), [](an4.61:16.1), [](an5.41:5.1), [](an5.227:2.3), and [](an6.37:1.2).",
  "pli-tv-kd3:5.6.1": "[See essay on _pāsāda_.] | As elsewhere, I have rendered _aḍḍhayoga_, _pāsāda_, and _hammiya_ together a “stilt house”. According to the commentaries, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. [Sp.4.294](): _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” [Sp-ṭ.3.4.294]() clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” [Sp.4.294]() continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At [Sp-ṭ.3.3.74](), however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.",

  "pli-tv-kd3:6.11.4": "“Conducts himself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released” renders _sammā vattati, lomaṁ pāteti, netthāraṁ vattati_. The first of these phrases is straightforward, but the last two are more difficult. Commenting on _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 13, [Sp.1.435]() explains: _Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti_, “_Na lomaṁ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṁ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.",
