The name suggests that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhattagga</i> was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries, as can be seen from the present passage. Since they were part of houses, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhattagga</i>, except in monasteries.
