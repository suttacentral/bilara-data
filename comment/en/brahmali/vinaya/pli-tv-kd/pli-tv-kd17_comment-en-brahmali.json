  "pli-tv-kd17:1.2.24": "“Go ahead” renders _upajānāhi_. According to [Sp.4.330](), _upajānāhi_ is just another word for _jānāhi_. [Sp-ṭ.3.4.330]() adds: _Jānāhīti cettha paṭipajjāti attho veditabbo_, “_Jānāhi_: here the meaning ‘practise’ should be understood.”",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.20": "_Saṅghāṭipattacīvaradharo_. In the _vinaya_ _saṅghāṭi_ frequently refers to whatever robe is worn on the upper body without distinguishing whether it is the single layered one or the double layered one. In other instances where _saṅghāṭi_ and _cīvara_ are spoken of together, as they are here, the _cīvara_ seems to refer to the third robe, which is often spare, whereas the _saṅghāṭi_ refers to the upper robe. See for instance [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.21) where we find the following: _Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū pacchābhattaṁ piṇḍapātapaṭikkantā ārāmaṁ gantvā pattacīvaraṁ paṭisāmetvā bahārāmakoṭṭhake saṅghāṭipallatthikāya nisīdiṁsu_, “After the meal they returned to the monastery, put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gateway, supported by their upper robe.”",

  "pli-tv-kd17:3.1.12": "_Kheḷāsaka_, lit. “an eater of spittle”. The spittle apparently refers to the gains, honor, and fame he has acquired in an inappropriate manner. [Sp.4.336]() says: _Kheḷāsakassāti ettha micchājīvena uppannapaccayā ariyehi vantabbā kheḷasadisā, tathārūpe paccaye ayaṁ ajjhoharatīti katvā kheḷāsakoti bhagavatā vutto_, “_Kheḷāsakassa_ here means that those requisites he has acquired though wrong livelihood, which the noble ones would vomit up like spittle, such requisites he has swallowed down. _Kheḷāsakassa_ was said by the Buddha in this connection.”",
  "pli-tv-kd17:3.8.22": "Here I follow the PTS edition. The Mahāsaṅgīti adds, “The Buddha then said to them, ‘Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.’ And he sent them down a different path”, which is absent from the PTS edition. This seems to be an error in the Mahāsaṅgīti based on automatic copying from the previous paragraphs.",
