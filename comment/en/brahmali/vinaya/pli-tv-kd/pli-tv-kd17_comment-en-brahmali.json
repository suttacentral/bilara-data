  "pli-tv-kd17:1.2.9": "Sp-ṭ 4.330: _Ujuṁ kārāpetabbanti puñjaṁ kārāpetabbaṁ_, “To be made straight means to be made into heaps.” It seems from this that the original meaning may have been _ujuṁ kārāpetabbaṁ_ rather than _puñjaṁ kārāpetabbaṁ_. I interpret “to make straight” as organizing the harvest into sheaves. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.2.24": "“Go ahead” renders _upajānāhi_. According to Sp 4.330, _upajānāhi_ is just another word for _jānāhi_. Sp-ṭ 4.330 adds: _Jānāhīti cettha paṭipajjāti attho veditabbo_, “_Jānāhi_: here the meaning ‘practice’ should be understood.” ",

  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.20": "“Wearing his robes and carrying his bowl” renders _saṅghāṭipattacīvaradharo_. In the _vinaya_, _saṅghāṭi_ frequently refers to whatever robe is worn on the upper body without distinguishing whether it is the single layered one or the double layered one. In other instances where _saṅghāṭi_ and _cīvara_ are spoken of together, as they are here, the _cīvara_ seems to refer to the third robe, which is often spare, whereas the _saṅghāṭi_ refers to the upper robe. See for instance [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8:1.7.21]() where we find the following: _Atha kho mettiyabhūmajakā bhikkhū pacchābhattaṁ piṇḍapātapaṭikkantā ārāmaṁ gantvā pattacīvaraṁ paṭisāmetvā bahārāmakoṭṭhake saṅghāṭipallatthikāya nisīdiṁsu_, “When they had eaten their meal and returned from alms round, they put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gatehouse, using their upper robes as back-and-knee straps.” See also note on _saṅghāṭi_ in Appendix I: Technical Terms.

  "pli-tv-kd17:3.1.12": "_Kheḷāsaka_, literally, “an eater of spittle”. The spittle apparently refers to the material support, honor, and praise he had acquired in an inappropriate manner. Sp 4.336 says: _Kheḷāsakassāti ettha micchājīvena uppannapaccayā ariyehi vantabbā kheḷasadisā, tathārūpe paccaye ayaṁ ajjhoharatīti katvā kheḷāsakoti bhagavatā vutto_, “_Kheḷāsakassa_ here means that those requisites he had acquired through wrong livelihood, which the noble ones would vomit up like spittle, such requisites he has swallowed down. _Kheḷāsakassa_ was said by the Buddha in this connection.” ",

The text means, “The Buddha then said to them, ‘Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.’ And he sent them down a different path”.

Although the Buddha was the only authority in laying down rules, the Sangha was autonomous in its decision making. For practical purposes, it was the Sangha that Devadatta was breaking with. ",

  "pli-tv-kd17:5.5.20": "This is only found in MS, and is missing in the PTS edition. It could be rendered as follows: “He has the view that what he says is legitimate and the view that the schism is legitimate.” This seems to be a mistake in MS, since the whole point of this is that the monk “misrepresents his view of what’s true, his belief of what’s true, his acceptance of what’s true, or his sentiment of what’s true”. This assessment is supported by the fact that the parallel passage at [pli-tv-pvr19:80.1]() does not have this combination. See Sp 5.477, which gives the details on this passage, which is only contracted in the Canonical text. ",
