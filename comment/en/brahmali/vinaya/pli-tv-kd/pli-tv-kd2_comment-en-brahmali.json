  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7": "Apart from the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vihāra</i>, “a dwelling”, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>guha</i>, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i>, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Sp.4.294: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ</i>, “An <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is a house bent like a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i>.” Sp-ṭ.3.4.294 clarifies: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkageha</i>: a house made in the shape of the wings of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garula</i> (=<i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuda</i>).” Sp.4.294 continues: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo.

A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> is just a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ.3.3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations.

  "pli-tv-kd2:24.3.4": "“Enemies of monks” is a translation of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>. At <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-pārājika</i> 1, I have translated the same compound as “enemy monks”. At <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-pārājika</i> 1 this seems required because various people who are acting as enemies of monks are mentioned separately, such as kings, bandits, and scoundrels. Moreover, all of these are compounded with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccatthikā</i>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rājapaccatthikā</i>, and so on. Since it seems reasonable to assume that all these compounds have the same structure, it follows that they should all be read as “enemies who are so-and-so” rather than “enemies of so-and-so”. This understanding is confirmed by Sp.1.58: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhū eva paccatthikā bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhikkhupaccatthikā</i> are just monks who are enemies.” In the present context, however, this interpretation does not seem to work. If <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i> refers to enemies who are monks, then they would have to be invited to take part in the ceremony, or some other arrangement would have to be made, but nothing is said about this in either the Pali or the commentaries. Moreover, kings, bandits, and scoundrels are in this case not compounded with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccatthikā</i>, as they are in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-pārājika</i> 1. I therefore conclude that the meaning here must be “enemies of monks”. ",
