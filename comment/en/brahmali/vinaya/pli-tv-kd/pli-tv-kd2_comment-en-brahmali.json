  "pli-tv-kd2:2.1.9": "The Pali has ellipses points at the end of this sentence. This seems to be a mistake. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:7.1.8": "The Pali for 50, 65, 80, and 40 kilometers is 4, 5, 6, and 3 _yojanas_ respectively. [See essay on Measures.] The commentary, [Sp.3.140](), explains “40 kilometers at the most” as follows: _Sammannantena pana majjhe ṭhatvā yathā catūsupi disāsu diyaḍḍhadiyaḍḍhayojanaṁ hoti, evaṁ sammannitabbā. Sace pana majjhe ṭhatvā ekekadisato tiyojanaṁ karonti, chayojanaṁ hotīti na vaṭṭati. Caturassaṁ vā tikoṇaṁ vā sammannantena yathā koṇato koṇaṁ tiyojanaṁ hoti, evaṁ sammannitabbā_, “If a sangha is establishing a boundary, it is to be established thus: while standing in the middle, 20 kilometers (one and a half _yojanas_) in each of the four directions. It is not allowable, however, if, while standing in the middle, they make it 80 kilometers (six _yojanas_) by making it 40 kilometers (three _yojanas_) in each direction. If a sangha is establishing a quadrangular or triangular boundary, it is to be established thus: 40 kilometers (three _yojanas_) from corner to corner.”",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.1": "The point seems to be that they recited the _pātimokkha_ in a different place every half-month. [Sp.3.141](): _Anupariveṇiyanti ekasīmamahāvihāre tasmiṁ tasmiṁ pariveṇe_, “‘In one precincts after another’ means in this or that precincts within a large monastery within one boundary.”",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7": "Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling”, and the _guha_, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. [Sp.4.294](): _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” [Sp-ṭ.3.4.294]() clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” [Sp.4.294]() continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At [Sp-ṭ.3.3.74](), however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.",
  "pli-tv-kd2:12.7.2": "That is, seven _abbhantaras_. [See essay on Measures.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:18.4.4": "“By name” renders the obscure compound _nāmaggena_. The commentaries are silent. Alternative readings include _nāmamattena_, _gaṇamaggena_, and _nasamaggena_, none of which makes good sense in the context.",
  "pli-tv-kd2:21.2.4": "[See essay on _mattika_ and _cuṇṇa_.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:24.3.5": "“Enemies of monks” is a translation of _bhikkhupaccatthikā_. At _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1, I have translated the same compound as “enemy monks”. At _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1 this seems required because various people who are acting as enemies of monks are mentioned separately, such as kings, bandits, and scoundrels. Moreover, all of these are compounded with _paccatthikā_: _bhikkhupaccatthikā_, _rājapaccatthikā_, and so on. Since it seems reasonable to assume that all these compounds have the same structure, it follows that they should all be read as “enemies who are so-and-so” rather than “enemies of so-and-so”. This understanding is confirmed by at [Sp.1.58](): _bhikkhū eva paccatthikā bhikkhupaccatthikā_, “_Bhikkhupaccatthikā_ are just monks who are enemies.” In the present context, however, this interpretation does not seem to work. If _bhikkhupaccatthikā_ refers to enemies who are monks, then they would have to be invited to take part in the ceremony, or some other arrangement would have to be made, but nothing is said about this in either the Pali or the commentaries. Moreover, kings, bandits, and scoundrels are in this case not compounded with _paccatthikā_, as they are in _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1. I therefore conclude that the meaning here must be “enemies of monks”.",
  "pli-tv-kd2:28.1.3": "Here “resident monk” means a monk who is within the _sīmā_, the monastery boundary.",
  "pli-tv-kd2:36.4.1": "“A passed-on purity that has expired”, _pārivāsikapārisuddhidānena_, seems to refer to purity that was conveyed for a different occasion. So long as the assembly is still seated, the occasion is regarded as the same. See _bhikkhunī-pācittiya_ 81 for a more detailed explanation."
