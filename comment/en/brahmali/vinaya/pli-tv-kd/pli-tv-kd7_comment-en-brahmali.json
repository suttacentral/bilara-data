Each section is made up of a large panel (_maṇḍala_) and a medium-sized panel (_aḍḍhamaṇḍala_) with a strip (_aḍḍhakusi_) in between. In this case _maṇḍala_ seems to be used as an umbrella term for both _maṇḍala_ and _aḍḍhamaṇḍala_. Sp 3.308: _Mahāmaṇḍalaaḍḍhamaṇḍalāni dassetvā_, “Showing large panels and medium-sized panels.” See also [pli-tv-kd8:12.2.3](). ",

  "pli-tv-kd7:12.1.1": "“Whose meditation is going well” renders _phāsuvihārika_. _Vihāra_ is a common _sutta_ term for a state of meditation, as in _diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra_, “a happy (meditation) abiding in this very life”, which is a reference to the four _jhānas_. _Phāsu_ means “comfortable” or “at ease”. Although this may be understood quite broadly, it seems likely that meditation would be the main connotation. "
