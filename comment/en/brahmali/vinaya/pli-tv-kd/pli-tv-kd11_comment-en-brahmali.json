  "pli-tv-kd11:5.1.13": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṁ</i>. Sp.4.76 says: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbanti aññamaññaṁ yojetvā kalaho na kāretabbo</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na bhikkhūhi sampayojetabbaṁ</i> means they should not quarrel when they associate with each other.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd11:5.1.15": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na savacanīyaṁ kātabbaṁ</i>. The literal meaning of this is: “He should not do a speaking together (with a regular monk).” Sp.4.76: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na savacanīyaṁ kātabbanti palibodhatthāya vā pakkosanatthāya vā savacanīyaṁ na kātabbaṁ, palibodhatthāya hi karonto “ahaṁ āyasmantaṁ imasmiṁ vatthusmiṁ savacanīyaṁ karomi, imamhā āvāsā ekapadampi mā pakkāmi, yāva na taṁ adhikaraṇaṁ vūpasantaṁ hotī”ti evaṁ karoti. Pakkosanatthāya karonto “ahaṁ te savacanīyaṁ karomi, ehi mayā saddhiṁ vinayadharānaṁ sammukhībhāvaṁ gacchāmā”ti evaṁ karoti; tadubhayampi na kātabbaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Savacanīya</i> is not to be done: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>savacanīya</i> is not to be done for the purpose of (creating) an obstacle or for the purpose of summoning. Acting for the purpose of (creating) an obstacle is done like this: ‘I am doing <i lang='pi' translate='no'>savacanīya</i> against the Venerable in regard to this offense: do not depart from this monastery with even one foot so long as this legal issue has not been settled.’ Acting for the purpose of summoning is done like this: ‘I am doing <i lang='pi' translate='no'>savacanīya</i> against you: come with me and let us go to the presence of a master of the Monastic Law.’” ",

  "pli-tv-kd11:6.1.2": "The meaning of the first of these phrases, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sammā vattati</i>, is straightforward, but the last two, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lomaṁ pāteti</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>netthāraṁ vattati</i>, are more difficult. Commenting on <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa</i> 13, Sp.1.435 explains the negative version of these phrases thus: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātenti</i>: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na netthāraṁ vattanti</i>: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out [of the offense].” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way.

  "pli-tv-kd11:6.2.9": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Okāsaṃ kāreti</i> literally means “he has (the other) make an opportunity”.

  "pli-tv-kd11:18.3.7": "According to the commentary this is an insult. Citta had a relative who was a baker, a low class occupation. By asking for sesame cookies, Sudhamma was apparently trying to remind Citta of his low class relative, thereby insulting him. ",
  "pli-tv-kd11:34.1.16": "All versions of the Pali available to me have this reading, which presumably is wrong. The expected reading is that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghakamma</i> should <em>not</em> be lifted. Ariṭṭha has returned to lay life. To lift the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghakamma</i> done against him would only be possible if he were still a monk. Moreover, even if he were a monk, he would have to give up his view before the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghakamma</i> could be lifted. "
