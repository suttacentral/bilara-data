Apart from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vihāra</i>, “dwellings”, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>guhā</i>, “caves”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i>, all of which, according to the commentaries, are different kinds of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt houses”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. Sp 4.294: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ</i>, “An <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is a house bent like a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i>.” Sp-ṭ 4.294 clarifies: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Supaṇṇavaṅkageha</i>: a house made in the shape of the wings of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḷa</i>.” A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḷa</i>, better known in its Sanskrit form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḍa</i>, is a mythological bird.

A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> is just a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ 3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
