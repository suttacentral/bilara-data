  "pli-tv-kd16:1.2.16": "[See essay on _pāsāda_.] | Apart from _vihāra_, “dwellings”, and _guha_, “caves”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt houses”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. [Sp.4.294](): _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” [Sp-ṭ.3.4.294]() clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” [Sp.4.294]() continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At [Sp-ṭ.3.3.74](), however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. | [See essay on _guhā_.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd16:2.1.11": "“Door frame” renders _piṭṭhasaṅghāṭa_. The precise meaning of the two words that make up this compound is never clarified in the Pali texts, but it seems clear enough that the compound as a whole refers to the entire door frame, for instance when it is used to define the _dvārakosa_ at _bhikkhu-pācitttiya_ 19. [Vmv.1.349](): Piṭṭhasaṅghāṭo nāma dvārabāhasaṅkhāto caturassadārusaṅghāṭo, yattha sauttarapāsaṁ kavāṭaṁ apassāya dvāraṁ pidahanti, “Piṭṭhasaṅghāṭo: a rectangular binding together of wood, called a doorcase, where the door with its hinges are supported and shut the doorway.” | “Lower and upper hinges” renders _udukkhalika_ and _uttarapāsaka_, respectively. [Sp.1.77](): … _yena kenaci kavāṭaṁ katvā heṭṭhā udukkhale upari uttarapāsake ca pavesetvā kataṁ parivattakadvārameva saṁvaritabbaṁ … atha dvārassa udukkhalaṁ vā uttarapāsako vā bhinno vā hoti aṭṭhapito vā, saṁvarituṁ na sakkoti_, “Having made a door by whatever (material), having entered it into the _udukkhala_ below and into the _uttarapāsaka_ above, it is made a revolving door to be closed … but when the _udukkhala_ or the _uttarapāsaka_ is broken or not mounted, then one cannot close the door.” From this it seems that the _udukkhala_ and _uttarapāsaka_, together with the two corresponding “projecting pivots” on the door, are the functional equivalents of hinges. _Udukkhalika_ and _udukkhala_ refer to the same thing, the former being used in the canonical text, whereas the latter is found in the summary verses. For further details see the Critical Pali Dictionary under _uttarapāsaka_.",

[MN-a.1.154]() comments: _Phusitaggaḷanti dvārabāhāhi saddhiṁ supihitakavāṭaṁ_, “With a touching door: the door-panel closes well with the door frame.” The point seems to be that the door is closed all the way so that it touches the door frame.",

It is where three or four holes are made for inserting bolts.” Whenever the Canonical text lists the parts of a door and door frame, the _aggaḷavaṭṭi_ always has the same position, being grouped together with the parts for the locking mechanism, such as bolts. Given the commentarial explanation, it is natural to think that it was a special post added to the door frame for the purpose of receiving bolts. | _Kapisīsaka_.
