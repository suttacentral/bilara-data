In this case the measure of the season is just the season. If the rainy season, etc., is not complete, one should calculate the days until the completion of the season; that share of days (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>divasabhāga</i>) is to be pointed out. Alternatively, ‘This is the name of the season, and it is complete or incomplete (by so many days)’, in this way the date is to be pointed out. ‘It is morning or evening’, in this way the part of the day is to be pointed out.” I have followed the latter of these two ways of understanding these terms, see the CPD. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅgīti ācikkhitabbā</i>, literally, “A joint recitation is to be declared”, which is rather cryptic. Sp 3.128: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅgītīti idameva sabbaṁ ekato katvā “tvaṁ kiṁ labhasi, kā te chāyā, kiṁ utuppamāṇaṁ, ko divasabhāgo”ti puṭṭho “idaṁ nāma labhāmi – vassaṁ vā hemantaṁ vā gimhaṁ vā, ayaṁ me chāyā, idaṁ utuppamāṇaṁ, ayaṁ divasabhāgoti vadeyyāsī”ti evaṁ ācikkhitabbaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅgīti</i>: here it means: having brought everyone together, it should pointed out: “When you are asked, ‘What did you have? What time did you have? What date did you have?’ you should reply, ‘I had this: it was the rainy season/the cold season/the hot season; I had this time; I had this date.’” The point seems to be that a newly ordained monk should remember the time and date of his ordination so that he may respond to questions about it in future.

In regard to this, having brought (everyone) together, it is to be pointed out. ‘What did you have’ means: at the time of the ordination, which year did you have, which season; your ordination was obtained in which one?” ",

Apart from the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vihāra</i>, “a dwelling”, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>guhā</i>, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i>, all of which, according to the commentaries, are different kinds of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say.

A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> is just a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ 3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
