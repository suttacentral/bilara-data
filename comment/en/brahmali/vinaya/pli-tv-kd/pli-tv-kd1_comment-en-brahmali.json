In the Chāndogya Upaniṣa, this syllable, like the syllable _om_, had a ritualistic purpose with mystical connotations. In the verse below, “the brahmin … who does not murmur mystical mantras”, _brāhmaṇa … nihuṁhuṅka_, is intended to capture the idea that a true brahmin, a perfected individual, does not utter such syllables.

Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. Sp 4.294: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” Sp-ṭ 4.294 clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garuḷa_.” A _garuḷa_, better known in its Sanskrit form _garuḍa_, is a mythological bird.

A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ 3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations.

  "pli-tv-kd1:77.1.13": "For an explanation of the renderings “stilt house” and “cave” respectively for _pāsāda_ and _guhā_, see Appendix I: Technical Terms. Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling”, and the _guhā_, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries, are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. Sp 4.294: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” Sp-ṭ 4.294 clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garuḷa_.” A _garuḷa_, better known in its Sanskrit form _garuḍa_, is a mythological bird. Sp 4.294 continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ 3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
