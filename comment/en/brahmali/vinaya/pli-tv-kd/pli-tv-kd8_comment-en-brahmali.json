  "pli-tv-kd8:30.3.1": "“Has been offered” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i>. This word, which literally means “arisen”, varies slightly in meaning dependent on the context. Often it refers to a requisite that has just been given to the Sangha or an individual monastic. Occasionally however, such as here, this does not fit the context, because the giving of the cloth is specifically said to happen afterwards. In other words, here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i> happens first, and only then is the robe given. The meaning, then, must be that the monks had been given an offer or a promise of robe-cloth, but had not yet received it. In a sense, the robe-cloth had “become available” to them. The most common way for a requisite to become available to a monastic is that an offer is made. I translate accordingly. See also DOP for this meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i>. ",

Also, if this were to be done by the Sangha in that monastery, then, with this much, even if seated here, it is as if seated there.
