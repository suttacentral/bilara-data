  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:2.1.10": "“Sibling” renders _bhātaro_, literally “brothers”. In the Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both genders. For instance, the plural of _putta_, literally “sons”, often means “children”. In the same way, the plural of _bhātā_ can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding nouns that normally refers to males is confirmed by the Pali lexical work called the Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā: _Ettha hi mātā ca pitā ca pitaro, putto ca dhītā ca puttā, sassu ca sasuro ca sasurā, bhātā ca bhaginī ca bhātaroti bhinnaliṅgānampi ekaseso dassitoti_, “‘Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.”,
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.11": "_Mānattaṁ deti_. For the meaning of _mānatta_ see “A Translation and Analysis of the Pātimokkha”, by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word _saṅghādisesa_ (_saṅgha_ + _ādisesa_) is derived from the fact that only the _sangha_ can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:4.27": "_Usseko_, which I take to be related to _seka_, perhaps via the prefix _ud_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.9.7": "Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues in Buddhist Monastic Code I, page 105, that it was the novice monk who emitted semen. But these rules concern monks, not novices. In the present case the Buddha specifically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisea_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his reading is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisea_ offenses can be occurred by indirect stimulation. I disagree. These cases are limited in scope and do not always include all the factors required for the committing of an offense."
