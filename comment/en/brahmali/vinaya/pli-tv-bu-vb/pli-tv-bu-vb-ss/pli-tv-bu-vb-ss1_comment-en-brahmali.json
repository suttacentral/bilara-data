For the meaning of _mānatta_ see “A Translation and Analysis of the Pātimokkha”, by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word _saṅghādisesa_ (_saṅgha_ + _ādisesa_) is derived from the fact that only the _sangha_ can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense.

In the present case the Buddha specifically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisea_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his reading is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisea_ offenses can be incurred by indirect stimulation. Yet the cases found here are widely diverging. It is not given that they must all, potentially, be _saṅghādiseas_. ",
