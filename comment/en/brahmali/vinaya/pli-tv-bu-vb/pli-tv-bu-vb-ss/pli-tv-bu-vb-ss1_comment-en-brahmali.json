  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:2.2.11": "“Gives the trial period” renders _mānattaṁ deti_. For the meaning of _mānatta_ see TAP, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word _saṅghādisesa_ (_saṅgha_ + _ādisesa_) is derived from the fact that only the _saṅgha_ can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense. | “Several” renders _sambahula_. _Sambahula_ normally means “many” or “a number of”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka, however, such as the present context, it is also used in a technical sense to mean a number of monastics greater than one but less than a Sangha, in other words, two or three monastics. In these instances, I render _sambahula_ as “several”. In the Campeyyakkhandhaka at Vin 5.174, _sambahula_ is used in an even more restricted sense. There it refers to more than two monastics but less than a Sangha, that is, exactly three monastics. In that context I render it simply as “three”. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.9.7": "Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues in BMC I, page 105, that it was the novice monk who emitted semen. But these rules concern monks, not novices. In the present case the Buddha specifically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisesa_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his reading is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisesa_ offenses can be incurred by indirect stimulation. Yet the cases found here are widely diverging. It is not a given that they must all, even potentially, give rise to a _saṅghādisesa_. ",
