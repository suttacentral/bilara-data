  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.2": "The meaning of the first of these phrases, _sammā vattati_, is straightforward, but the last two, _lomaṁ pāteti_ and _netthāraṁ vattati_, are more difficult. Sp 1.435: _Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti_, “_Na lomaṁ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṁ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out (of the offense).” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way. For the further development of these events, see [pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1]()–16.1.28.│“Disrobe” renders _vibbhamissāmi_. According to PED and SED the general meaning of this word is something like “to go astray”. However, the implied meaning throughout the Vinaya Piṭaka is that one leaves the Sangha, that is, one disrobes. I therefore take this word to express the functional equivalence of disrobing. This is supported by the commentaries. Sp 1.435: _Vibbhamantīti ekacce gihī honti_, “_Vibbhamanti_: some became householders.” Sp 4.434: _Yadeva sā vibbhantāti yasmā sā vibbhantā attano ruciyā khantiyā odātāni vatthāni nivatthā, tasmāyeva sā abhikkhunī, na sikkhāpaccakkhānenāti dasseti_, “_Yadeva sā vibbhantā_ means she is no longer a nun because, according to her own preference and choice, she dresses in white.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.8": "For the rendering of _mattika_ and _cuṇṇa_ as respectively “soap” and “bath powder”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.58": "The Pali just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
