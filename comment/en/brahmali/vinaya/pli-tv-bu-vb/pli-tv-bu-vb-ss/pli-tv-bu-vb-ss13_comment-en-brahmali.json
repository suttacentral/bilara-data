  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.2": "The meaning of the first of these phrases, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sammā vattati</i>, is straightforward, but the last two, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lomaṁ pāteti</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>netthāraṁ vattati</i>, are more difficult. Sp 1.435: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na lomaṁ pātenti</i>: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Na netthāraṁ vattanti</i>: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out (of the offense).” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way. For the further development of these events, see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/brahmali#13.1.1'>Kd 11:13.1.1</a>–16.1.28.│“Disrobe” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vibbhamissāmi</i>. According to PED and SED the general meaning of this word is something like “to go astray”. However, the implied meaning throughout the Vinaya Piṭaka is that one leaves the Sangha, that is, one disrobes. I therefore take this word to express the functional equivalence of disrobing. This is supported by the commentaries. Sp 1.435: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vibbhamantīti ekacce gihī honti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vibbhamanti</i>: some became householders.” Sp 4.434: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Yadeva sā vibbhantāti yasmā sā vibbhantā attano ruciyā khantiyā odātāni vatthāni nivatthā, tasmāyeva sā abhikkhunī, na sikkhāpaccakkhānenāti dasseti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Yadeva sā vibbhantā</i> means she is no longer a nun because, according to her own preference and choice, she dresses in white.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.8": "For the rendering of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mattika</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>cuṇṇa</i> as respectively “soap” and “bath powder”, see Appendix I: Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.58": "The Pali just says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i>, without specifying that it is an <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti</i>, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i>. The implication is that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
