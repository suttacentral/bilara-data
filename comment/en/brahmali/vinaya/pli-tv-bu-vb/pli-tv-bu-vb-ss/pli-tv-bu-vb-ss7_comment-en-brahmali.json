  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.19.1": "I have rendered _sassāmikaṁ_ as “with a sponsoring owner”. The word _sāmika_ generally means “owner”, and there seems to be no reason why that should not also be the meaning here. However, although the monk does not own the dwelling, he is still the builder and the intended user once the building is finished. To indicate this, I have added the word “sponsoring”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:2.2": "I render _vihāra_ as “dwelling”, the idea that it is a monastic dwelling being implied. In later usage, especially in the commentaries, _vihāra_ comes to refer to entire monasteries, rather than individual dwellings. The commentaries seems to agree that in its early usage the word refers to a dwelling. Sp 1.493: _Vihāro nivesanasadiso_, “A _vihāra_ is like a house.” ",
