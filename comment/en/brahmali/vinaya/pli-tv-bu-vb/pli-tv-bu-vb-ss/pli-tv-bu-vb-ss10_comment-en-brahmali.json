Sp 1.410: _Cakkabhedāyāti āṇābhedāya_, “_Cakkabhedāya_: by breaking the authority.” Vjb 4.343: _Cakkabhedanti sāsanabhedaṁ_, “_Cakkabheda_: a break in the instruction.” The break in authority is presumably both from the Buddha and the Sangha. Although the Buddha was the only authority in laying down rules, the Sangha was autonomous in its decision making. For practical purposes, it was the Sangha that Devadatta was breaking with. ",

Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
