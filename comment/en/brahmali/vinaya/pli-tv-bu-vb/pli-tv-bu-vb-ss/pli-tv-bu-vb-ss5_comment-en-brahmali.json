  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.3": "The Pali reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yattha passati kumārakaṁ vā apajāpatikaṁ kumārikaṁ vā apatikaṁ kumārakassa</i>, literally, “When Udāyi saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband”. However, since the “or” gives an awkward meaning in English, I have replaced it with “and”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.15": "Literally, “We don’t know you.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.4.19": "At first glance the Pali seems to concern a single wife who is protected in two ways, not two separate wives. However, since the immediately following question is phrased in the plural, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hotha … bhariyāyo dhanakkītā</i>, “please be the bought wives,” it is clear that this is about two wives. To bring this out in translation, I have added “so-and-so” to each potential wife. ",
