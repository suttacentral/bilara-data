  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.1.3": "The Pali reads _yattha passati kumārakaṁ vā apajāpatikaṁ kumārikaṁ vā apatikaṁ kumārakassa_, literally, “When Udāyi saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband”. However, since the “or” gives an awkward meaning in English, I have replaced it with “and”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:1.3.15": "Literally, “We don’t know you.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.2.17": "Sp 1.303: _Saha ārakkhenāti sārakkhā_, “_Sārakkha_ means having protection.” Sp-ṭ 1.303: _Sasāmikā sārakkhā_; “_Sārakkhā_ means having a husband.” But it clearly does not mean marriage in a modern sense. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.3.10": "Sp 1.303: _Odapattakinīti ubhinnaṁ ekissā udakapātiyā hatthe otāretvā “idaṁ udakaṁ viya saṁsaṭṭhā abhejjā hothā”ti vatvā pariggahitāya vohāranāmametaṁ, niddesepissa “tāya saha udakapattaṁ āmasitvā taṁ vāsetī”ti evamattho veditabbo_; “_Odapattakinī_: this is an expression for both having entered their hand into a single bowl of water, saying, for the purpose of taking possession, ʻMay you not be split but be together like this water.ʼ Also, it may be specified like this: ʻAfter touching the bowl of water with you, he lives with you.ʼ The meaning is to be understood in this way.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.3.12": "Sp 1.303: _Obhaṭaṁ oropitaṁ cumbaṭamassāti obhaṭacumbaṭā, kaṭṭhahārikādīnaṁ aññatarā, yassā sīsato cumbaṭaṁ oropetvā ghare vāseti, tassā etaṁ adhivacanaṁ_; “_Obhaṭacumbaṭā_: her head pad, which is for carrying sticks, etc., has been removed. This is a term for one who is made to live in a house (with another), after removing the cloth pad from her head.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.4.19": "At first glance the Pali seems to concern a single wife who is protected in two ways, not two separate wives. However, since the immediately following question is phrased in the plural, _hotha … bhariyāyo dhanakkītā_, “please be the bought wives,” it is clear that this is about two wives. To bring this out in translation, I have added “so-and-so” to each potential wife. ",
