  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.8": "Sp 2.589: _Sīsūpagantiādīsu sīsaṁ upagacchatīti sīsūpagaṁ, potthakesu pana “sīsūpaka”nti likhitaṁ, yassa kassaci sīsālaṅkārassetaṁ adhivacanaṁ. Esa nayo sabbattha_, “In regard to ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ, etc., ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ means what goes to the head. In the books, however, it is written ʻ_sīsūpaka_ʼ. This is a term for whatever is an ornament for the head. This is the method everywhere.” The basic meaning of the Pali word _rūpiya_, here rendered as “money”, is silver. We can infer from this that the ornaments mentioned in the commentary must be made of silver. The commentary suggests that gold is also included: Sp 1.587: _Rūpiyasaṁvohāranti jātarūparajataparivattanaṁ_, “_Rūpiyasaṁvohāra_ means exchanging gold and silver.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.63.1": "The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges money for money. The same is true for the next two cases. Sp 1.589: _purimasikkhāpade vuttavatthūsu nissaggiyavatthunā nissaggiyavatthuṁ cetāpentassa_, “For one who is exchanging an object to be relinquished with another object to be relinquished, it is in accordance with the cases spoken of in the previous training rule.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.66": "The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges what is not money for money, that is, one is selling something and therefore ending up with money. Sp 1.589: _Attano vā hi arūpiyena parassa rūpiyaṁ cetāpeyya_, “Or one exchanges one’s own non-money for someone else’s money.” The same is true for the next two cases. "
