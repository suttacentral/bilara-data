  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:1.39": "The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ubhova santā ekena</i>, here translated as “put together”, is not immediately clear. It seems to me that this phrase needs to be related to the main sentence verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>acchādetha</i>, “present” or “give”, which takes the instrumental of the thing given: “present (him) with one (robe)”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ubhova santā</i> is explained below in the word commentary as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dvepi janā</i>, “both people”, and the overall phrase then becomes, “two people present (him) with one (robe)”. This means that the funds are put together, and I translate accordingly. ",

The generation of a grandfather is called a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pitāmahayuga</i>.” So the PaIi phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga</i> means “as far as the seventh generation of grandfathers”, that is, eight generations back. This can be counted as follows: (1) one’s grandfather; (2) his father; (3) 2’s father; (4) 3’s father; (5) 4’s father; (6) 5’s father; and (7) 6’s father. This applies to both one’s paternal and maternal grandfathers. This gives a total of 14 ancestors. Anyone who is a descendent of these fourteen is considered a relative. Anyone who is not such a descendent is not regarded as a relative. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np9:2.8": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Agāraṁ</i> is typically rendered as “in a house”. The problem with this is that it is not unallowable for a monastic to live in a building that is the equivalent of a house. What a monastic should not do is own a home and then live there. "
