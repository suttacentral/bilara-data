The generation of a grandfather is called a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pitāmahayuga</i>.” So the PaIi phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga</i> means “as far as the seventh generation of grandfathers”, that is, eight generations back. This can be counted as follows: (1) one’s grandfather; (2) his father; (3) 2’s father; (4) 3’s father; (5) 4’s father; (6) 5’s father; and (7) 6’s father. This applies to both one’s paternal and maternal grandfathers. This gives a total of 14 ancestors. Anyone who is a descendent of these fourteen is considered a relative. Anyone who is not such a descendent is not regarded as a relative. "
