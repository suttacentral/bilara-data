  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:1.1": "In the heading above, and also in the heading to [pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.1.1]() (and also at the end of each of these rules), I translate _kathina_ as “robe season” rather than “robe-making ceremony”, since this is the contextual meaning in these rules. For further discussion of the meaning of _kathina_, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.1.1": "“Was offered” renders _uppanna_. This word, which literally means “arisen”, varies slightly in meaning dependent on the context. Often it refers to a requisite that has just been given to the Sangha or an individual monastic. I then render _uppanna_ as “given”. Occasionally however, such as here, this does not fit the context, because Ānanda would have incurred a _nissaggiya pācittiya_ offense had he received the robe. In other words, here _uppanna_ happens first, and only afterwards is the robe given. The meaning, then, must be that Ānanda had been given an offer or a promise of a robe, but had not yet received it. In this sense the robe had “become available” to him. The most common way for a requisite to become available to a monastic is that an offer is made. I translate accordingly. See also DOP for this meaning of _uppanna_. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:3.1.2": "This refers to robe-cloth received during the robe season. For details see [pli-tv-kd7:1.7.3]()–13.2.7. “Finished” refers to the monk either having made a robe or having given up on making a robe. ",
