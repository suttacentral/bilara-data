In each instance below I have added the respective commentarial explanation, so as to make it clear what the arm’s reach relates to. ",

In fact, according to [Sp.1.482]() they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bald roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [Bu Np 2:3.4.1](pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.1)--3.5.4, the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.
