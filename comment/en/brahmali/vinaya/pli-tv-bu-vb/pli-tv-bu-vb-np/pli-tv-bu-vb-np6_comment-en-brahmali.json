  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:2.14": "“A communal robe” renders _vihāracīvara_, literally, “a dwelling robe”. Since “dwelling robe” is awkward in English, and because these robes did not belong to individual monastics, I prefer the given rendering. “A bedspread” renders _uttarattharaṇa_. Sp 1.517: _Uttarattharaṇanti mañcakassa upari attharaṇakaṁ vuccati_, “What is spread on top of a bed is called an _uttarattharaṇa_.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:3.1.6": "Sp 1.505: _Tattha yāva sattamā pitāmahayugāti pitupitā pitāmaho, pitāmahassa yugaṁ pitāmahayugaṁ_, “In this _yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga_ means: the father of a father is a grandfather. The generation of a grandfather is called a _pitāmahayuga_.” So the PaIi phrase _yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga_ means “as far as the seventh generation of grandfathers”, that is, eight generations back. This can be counted as follows: (1) one’s grandfather; (2) his father; (3) 2’s father; (4) 3’s father; (5) 4’s father; (6) 5’s father; and (7) 6’s father. This applies to both one’s paternal and maternal grandfathers. This gives a total of 14 ancestors. Anyone who is a descendent of these fourteen is considered a relative. Anyone who is not such a descendent is not regarded as a relative. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:3.1.8": "_Agāraṁ_ is typically rendered as “in a house”. The problem with this is that it is not unallowable for a monastic to live in a building that is the equivalent of a house. What a monastic should not do is own a home and then live there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np6:3.1.12": "The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp; see [pli-tv-kd8:3.1.6](). According to [pli-tv-kd8:21.1.4](), the size referred to here is no smaller than 8 by 4 _sugataṅgula_, “standard fingerbreadths”. For an explanation of the idea of _vikappanā_, see Appendix I: Technical Term. For the rendering of _cīvara_ as “robe-cloth”, see the same appendix. "
