According to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3/en/brahmali#2.3.1'>Bu Pc 3:2.3.1</a> the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks”. Sp 2.37 supports the plural rendering “monks”: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhikkhūnaṁ pesuññe</i>, “Malicious talebearing of monks”. ",

The ellipses points are also missing at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3/en/brahmali#2.2.26'>Bu Pc 3:2.2.26</a>. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.27": "This looks like an editing mistake. Presumably this should read, “We’re not going to a good destination/we can only expect a bad destination.” "
