SED defines <i lang='pi' translate='no'>phāṇita</i> as “the inspissated juice of the sugar cane or other plants”, in other words, “cane syrup”. According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”. ",
