  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc26:2.1.6": "[Sp.1.505](): _Tattha yāva sattamā pitāmahayugāti pitupitā pitāmaho, pitāmahassa yugaṃ pitāmahayugaṃ_, “In this _yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga_ means: the father of a father is a grandfather. The generation of a grandfather is called a _pitāmahayuga_.” So the PaIi phrase _yāva sattamā pitāmahayuga_ means “as far as the seventh generation of grandfathers”, that is, eight generations back. This can be counted as follows: (1) one’s grandfather; (2) his father; (3) 2’s father; (4) 3’s father; (5) 4’s father; (6) 5’s father; and (7) 6’s father. This applies to both one’s paternal and maternal grandfathers. This gives a total of 14 ancestors. Anyone who is a descendent of these fourteen is considered a relative. Anyone who is not such a descendent is not regarded as a relative. ",
