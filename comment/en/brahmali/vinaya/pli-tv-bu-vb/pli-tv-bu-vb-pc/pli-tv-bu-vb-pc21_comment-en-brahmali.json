Sp 2.149: _Niyyādetabboti appetabbo_ … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvāti eso bhaginiyo ovādoti avatvā_, “_Niyyādetabbo_: should display it. … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvā_: not having said, ‘Sisters, this is the instruction.’” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.22": "The Pali word behind the translation “monastery” is _āvāsa_. This refers to the area of the _simā_, the monastic zone, as established through a legal procedure. This area may be much larger than the space occupied by any actual buildings. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.38": "It is not entirely clear how this offense comes about, but it must somehow relate to what we find in segment 3.1.17 above. It seems the text here assumes that the nuns reply “no” to the follow-up question in segment 3.1.17 of whether they are keeping the important principles, in which case the appointed monk is supposed to recite them. Only if he does not do so at this point, does he incur an offense of wrong conduct under this rule. ",
