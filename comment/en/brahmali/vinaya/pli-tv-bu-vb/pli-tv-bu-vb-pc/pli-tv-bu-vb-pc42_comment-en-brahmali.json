  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42:2.2.4": "“Puts him down” renders _kalisāsanaṃ āropeti_. [Sp.2.277](): _Kalisāsanaṃ āropetīti “kalī”ti kodho; tassa sāsanaṃ āropeti; kodhassa āṇaṃ āropeti; kodhavasena ṭhānanisajjādīsu dosaṃ dassetvā “passatha bho imassa ṭhānaṃ, nisajjaṃ ālokitaṃ vilokitaṃ khāṇuko viya tiṭṭhati, sunakho viya nisīdati, makkaṭo viya ito cito ca viloketī”ti evaṃ amanāpavacanaṃ vadati “appeva nāma imināpi ubbāḷho pakkameyyā”ti_. “_Kalisāsanaṃ āropeti_: _kali_ means anger. He inflicts a teaching because of that; he inflicts punishment because of anger. He finds faults because of anger in regard to the standing, sitting, etc., saying, ‘See how he stands, sits, looks this way and that. He stands like a post, sits like a dog, looks here and there like a monkey.’ He speaks such unpleasant speech hoping he will depart in a huff.” "
