  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42:2.2.4": "“Puts him down” renders _kalisāsanaṁ āropeti_. Sp 2.277: _Kalisāsanaṁ āropetīti “kalī”ti kodho; tassa sāsanaṁ āropeti; kodhassa āṇaṁ āropeti; kodhavasena ṭhānanisajjādīsu dosaṁ dassetvā “passatha bho imassa ṭhānaṁ, nisajjaṁ ālokitaṁ vilokitaṁ khāṇuko viya tiṭṭhati, sunakho viya nisīdati, makkaṭo viya ito cito ca viloketī”ti evaṁ amanāpavacanaṁ vadati “appeva nāma imināpi ubbāḷho pakkameyyā”ti_. “_Kalisāsanaṁ āropeti_: _kali_ means anger. He inflicts a teaching because of that; he inflicts punishment because of anger. He finds faults because of anger in regard to the standing, sitting, etc., saying, ‘See how he stands, sits, looks this way and that. He stands like a post, sits like a dog, looks here and there like a monkey.’ He speaks such unpleasant speech hoping he will depart in a huff.” "
