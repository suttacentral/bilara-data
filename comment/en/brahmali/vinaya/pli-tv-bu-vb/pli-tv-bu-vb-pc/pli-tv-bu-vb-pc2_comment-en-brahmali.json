  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2:2.2.23.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kilāsa</i> is closely related to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kuṭṭha</i>. Sp.3.88: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kilāsoti na bhijjanakaṁ na paggharaṇakaṁ padumapuṇḍarīkapattavaṇṇaṁ kuṭṭhaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kilāsa</i> is leprosy without lesions, without discharge, and with the color of red and white lotuses.” It seems modern medical science distinguishes between tuberculoid leprosy, which is mild and has few lesions, and lepromatous leprosy, which is severe and has widespread lesions. It seems plausible to identify <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilāsa</i> with the former and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kuṭṭha</i> with the latter. But to avoid the technical Latinate medical vocabulary, I render them respectively as “mild leprosy” and “leprosy”. ",
