  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:1.3": "The Pali appears as a single sentence enclosed in quotes. Yet it is hard to see how this could have been spoken in one go, since some of the constituent clauses are mutually contradictory. For instance, the same legal procedure cannot have been both not done and badly done. I therefore take it that the individual clauses were spoken at different times. This method of putting together a number of independent utterances into a single quote is in fact quite common in the Vinaya Piṭaka. In most such cases I separate out the individual quotes. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:2.1.6": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>so vā āroceti</i>, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa (sā) āroceti</i> (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. <a href='/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali#3.1.6'>Sanskrit] <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ārocayate</i> med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-pācittiya</i> 29 [Bu Pc 29:3.1.6</a> where the text says that she tells (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sā vā āroceti</i>) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āroceti</i> cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it refers to the Sangha, or perhaps one of the monks who participated in the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghakamma</i>, having told him directly. "
