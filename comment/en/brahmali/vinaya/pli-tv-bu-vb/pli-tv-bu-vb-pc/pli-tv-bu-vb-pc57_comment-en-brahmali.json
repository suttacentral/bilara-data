  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:7.1.21": ". Half a _yojana_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometers (see “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon”, by Thomas Rhys Davids, p.16). Thus half a _yojana_ is just over 6 km."
