  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83:1.3.26": "_Putto vā pitaraṁ pattheti pitā vā puttaṁ pattheti_. The meaning of _pattheti_ is not clear. Bhikkhu Bodhi, in Numerical Discourses of the Buddha, AN10.45, translates it as “longs for”. [Sp.2.597]() gives the meaning, _Ghātetuṁ icchati_, “Wishes to strike/kill”, which is not the usual meaning of this word. Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary, however, gives “to seize or fall upon, attack, assail” under _prārthayate_, which is the Sanskrit equivalent of _pattheti_."
