  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:2.1.6": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>so vā āroceti</i>, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa (sā) āroceti</i> (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. <a href='/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali#3.1.6'>Sanskrit] <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ārocayate</i> med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-pācittiya</i> 29 [Bu Pc 29:3.1.6</a> where the text says that she tells (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sā vā āroceti</i>) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āroceti</i> cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the person wrongly ordained telling the monk directly. ",

Yet elsewhere, such as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa</i> 10-13, it is said that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> is annulled if you commit the full offense. The implication is that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkaṭa</i> should be read as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpatti dukkaṭassa</i>, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
