  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.2": "“Tonics” renders _bhesajja_. In the origin story below _bhesajja_ seems to refer to the five standard tonics, and I translate it accordingly. The commentary at Sp 2.306 glosses _bhesajja_ with _sappitelādīsu_, “Ghee, oil, etc.”, which lends some support to this view. In the actual rule, however, the word _paccaya_ is used, which suggests a broader meaning. See comment to the actual rule below. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.7": "According ACMC, p.18, one _doṇa_ is equivalent to 64 handfuls. This is perhaps roughly equivalent to one liter. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.27.1": "I render _paccaya_ as “requisites”, not as “tonics”. It might seem from the origin story and the word commentary below that this rule deals with tonics or medicines, _bhesajja_. The problem with this view, however, is that _paccaya_, when used alone, never has this meaning in the Vinaya, nor in the four main Nikāyas. When _paccaya_ is used by itself, it invariably means cause, condition, foundation, support, or something to this effect. It only refers to medicines in compounds such as _gilāna-ppaccaya-bhesajja-parikkhāra_, “medicines and requisites to _support_ the sick”, where it is the context that gives it its specific reference. In the present rule there is no such context. The meaning of the word remains “support”. Given that the rules must have existed before the Vibhaṅga, the meaning of the rule is independent of it. We can only conclude that the meaning of _paccaya_ must be “support”, that is, any material requisite that supports the monastic life. See [AN 4.79](an4.79:2.1) for the use of _paccaya_ in this sense. "
