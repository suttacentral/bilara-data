  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc66:1.6": "_Pajānāth’āvuso_, lit. “You know, friends.” According to the commentary, [DN-a.2.436](): _Tvaṁ pajānāhīti tvaṁ jāna. Sace gaṇhitukāmosi, gaṇhāhīti vuttaṁ hoti_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc66:2.1.6": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it refers to the group of travelers (i.e. the thieves or one of them) telling the monk directly.",
