CPD suggests: “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa (sā) āroceti</i> (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ārocayate</i> med. caus. in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali#3.1.6'>Bu Pc 29:3.1.6</a> where the text says that she tells (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sā vā āroceti</i>) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āroceti</i> cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the recipient telling the resentful monk directly. "
