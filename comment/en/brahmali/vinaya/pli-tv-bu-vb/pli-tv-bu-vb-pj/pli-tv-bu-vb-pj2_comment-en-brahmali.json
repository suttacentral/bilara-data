  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.1": "The text literally says “the dyers’ spread”, _rajakattharaṇaṁ_, but the commentary at Sp 1.90 qualifies that this refers to their spread of “cloth”, _vatthāni_. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:2.4": "For the rendering of _cīvara_ as “robe-cloth”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.6": "“Inhabited area” renders _gāma_. See Appendix I: Technical Terms for discussion. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.11": "“Access” renders _upacāra_. See Appendix I: Technical Terms for discussion. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.31": "For the following segments, because I have not tried to replicate the structure of the Pali—in this case the subordinate/demonstrative clause structure and the resulting repetitiveness—the next two terms defined in the Pali have no counterpart in my translation. But no information is lost since both terms have already been defined earlier. The two terms in question are _tathārūpaṁ_, which is defined in the same way as _yathārūpaṁ_, “the sort”, and secondly, _ādiyamāno_, which is defined in the same way as _ādiyeyya_, “takes”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:3.32": "",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.2.3": "“Goes there” renders _gacchati_. Sp 1.94: _Gacchati vā āpatti dukkaṭassāti evaṁ pariyiṭṭhasahāyakudālapiṭako nidhiṭṭhānaṁ gacchati_, “_Gacchati vā āpatti dukkaṭassa_: in this way he goes with the sought friend, with the spade and basket, to the place of the goods.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.2.6": "“Container” renders _kumbhi_, which actually is a pot or cooking vessel. In the present context, however, the pot is used as a container for goods. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.2.17": "“Syrup” renders _phāṇita_ I.B. Horner instead translates it as “molasses”, which doesn’t quite hit the mark. SED defines _phāṇita_ as “the inspissated juice of the sugar cane or other plants”, in other words, “cane syrup”. According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.4.3": "For a discussion of _hirañña_, see Appendix I: Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.5.3": "_Bhittikhilepi nāgadantakepi_, literally, “wall pegs and elephant tusks”. These are different kinds of pegs and I have not tried to differentiate between them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.10.2": "Since _ārāma_ is a standard term for a monastery in the Vinaya Piṭaka, monasteries are presumably included under this heading. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.10.15": "Sp 1.102: _Sāmikaṁ parājetīti vinicchayikānaṁ ukkocaṁ datvā kūṭasakkhiṁ otāretvā ārāmasāmikaṁ jinātīti attho_, “‘He defeats the owner’: having given a bribe to those deciding (the legal case), having brought a false witness, he defeats the owner of the park. This is the meaning.” In other words, the lawsuit is illegitimate. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.11.2": "I render _vihāra_ as “monastic dwelling”. In later usage, especially in the commentaries, _vihāra_ comes to refer to entire monasteries, rather than individual dwellings. The commentaries seems to agree that in its early usage the word refers to a dwelling. Sp 1.493: _Vihāro nivesanasadiso_, “A _vihāra_ is like a house.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.13.2": "Again, _ārāma_ means both park and monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.16.6": "The Pali text just says “into”, and I have added “the container holding the water” for clarity. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.20.4": "The Pali text just says that he evokes doubt in the mind of the owner, _sāmikassa vimatiṁ uppādeti_. That the doubt refers to the possibility of getting the goods back is supplied from the commentary. Sp 1.112: _“Dassati nu kho me no”ti sāmiko vimatiṁ uppādeti_, “He evokes doubt in the mind of the owner in this way, ‘Will he give it or not?’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:4.21.4": "Although not explicitly stated in the Canonical text, the commentary confirms that the value meant is the tax value. Sp 1.113: _Rājaggaṁ bhaṇḍanti: rājārahaṁ bhaṇḍaṁ; yato rañño pañcamāsakaṁ vā atirekapañcamāsakaṁ vā agghanakaṁ suṅkaṁ dātabbaṁ hoti, taṁ bhaṇḍanti attho_, “Goods having a value to the king means: goods having a worth to the king. The meaning is: the goods for which a tax having a value of five _māsaka_ coins or more is to be given to the king.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:6.4.3": "This refers to a situation where you have an agreement with a close friend that you may take their belongings on trust. The conditions for taking on trust are set out at [pli-tv-kd8:19.1.5](). ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.6.11": "I have added one set of ellipses points at the end of the sentence. They seem to have been omitted by mistake from the Pali. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.9.1": "“Disregarded the draw” renders _kusaṁ saṅkāmetvā_. _Kusa_-grass was used to draw lots when distributing robe-cloth, see [pli-tv-kd8:9.4.4](). ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.12.6": "“Fresh food” renders _khādanīya_. See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.21.12": "“Rose apple” renders _jambu_. The _jambu_ is normally identified with the rose apple (tree), but according to PED it is the Eugenia jambolana (tree), which is actually the black-plum tree. I have not been able to ascertain which of these interpretations is correct. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.25.2": "The unusual expression _vutto vajjemi_ recurs in the next two cases. _Vajjemi_ is apparently an optative formation from _vadāmi_, “I could say”, whereas _vutto_ is the past participle of _vuccati_, “spoken to”, the overall meaning being, “I, (having been) spoken to, could say to the family that supports you.” The idea conveyed seems to be the taking of a message. Sp 1.150: _Tava vacanena vadāmīti attho_, “The meaning is, ‘I will speak your statement.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.25.24": "According to ACMC, p.18, one _doṇa_ is equivalent to 64 handfuls. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.46.2": "Sp 1.158: _Etadavocāti gilāno hutvā avoca_, “‘He said’: he said it because of illness.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:7.47.3": "“Stilt house” renders _pāsāda_. See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. "
