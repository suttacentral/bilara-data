  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.19": "The literal meaning is “Good Gotama is disgusted,” but I am taking a bit of literary licence to make it more meaningful and punchy. It may well be that this was implied by the speaker. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1": "“Whiteheads” renders _setaṭṭ(h)ikā_, lit. “white bones”. [Sp.4.403](): _Setaṭṭhikā nāma rogajātīti eko pāṇako nāḷimajjhagataṁ kaṇḍaṁ vijjhati, yena viddhattā nikkhantampi sālisīsaṁ khīraṁ gahetuṁ na sakkoti_, “The disease called _setaṭṭhikā_ means: an insect penetrates the stem, goes to the middle of the stalk, from the penetration of which the rice grains are not able to get sap.” This seems to be a description of so-called “whiteheads”, pale panicles without rice grains, caused by stem borers. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.10": "_Setughāta_, lit. “destroyed the bridge”. [Sp.1.16](): _Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṁ hoti_, “The path is called the bridge. What is said is that there is the destruction and cutting off of such speech by the path.” The commentary seems to take _setu_, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access, that is, the Buddhas no longer have the possibility of doing what is unbeneficial. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.15": "I have supplied “the problems of famine” from the commentary to bring out the meaning. [Sp.1.16](): _Dubbhikkhe dullabhapiṇḍe imāya sallahukavuttitāya iminā ca sallekhena vijitaṁ_. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5": "[Sp.1.17](): _Ettha sādhūti āyācanavacanametaṃ_, “Here this _sādhu_ is expressing a question.” And the same below. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.12": "[Sp.1.32](): _Idañhi vuttaṃ hoti – “atthi nu kho, tāta sudinna, amhākaṃ dhanaṃ, na mayaṃ niddhanāti”_; “For this is said: ʻIsn't there, dear Sudinna, our wealth? We are not poor.ʼ” The point, perhaps, is that the father meant to say much more, but was interrupted at the shock of seeing his son eating old porridge. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.22": "[See essay on _hirañña_.] ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:7.1.16.1": "_Paccakkhāya_ from _paccakkhāti_ means to “speak against” or “renounce verbally”. To avoid clunkiness, I normally render this as “renounce”, except where the context requires the more complete formulation. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:8.2.33": "Here and in the next segment I have added ellipses points at the end. These ellipses points seem to have been omitted by mistake from the Pali. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.2.1": "“Intention of sexual relations” renders _sevanacitta_, lit. “intention of association”. The kind of association applicable to this rule, however, is sexual intercourse. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.2": "That is, he agrees to the sexual intercourse at each of these points. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.6.1": "The Pali phrase _aṅgajātena vaccamaggaṁ abhinisīdenti_ could be rendered, “They make (the monk) sit down with his penis in the anus.” Above we find the inverse expression, _vaccamaggena aṅgajātaṁ abhinisīdenti_, which could be rendered, “They make (the woman) sit on his penis with her anus.” The effect is the same, but the agent in the two cases is different. Since the agent is clear from the context, I have rendered the two expressions in the same way. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.7.7.1": "[See appendix for an explanation of the words _magga_ and _amagga_ as used here.] | In this section, as above, the instrumental case signifies the orifice that is entered. This may seem unusual, but it follows the pattern found elsewhere where the gateway through which anything (such as a house, a village, or a cul-de-sac) is entered is in the instrumental case. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.3.18": "[Sp.1.67](): _Phalakacīraṁ nāma phalakasaṇṭhānāni phalakāni sibbitvā katacīraṁ_, “_Phalakacīra_: a robe made by sewing together bits of wood or what has the appearance of wood.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.11.1": "[Sp.1.73]() explains the ablative Rājagahā as a locative Rājagahe. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.13.12": "[Sp-ṭ.2.73](): _Vaṭṭakateti imassa atthaṃ dassento ‘‘vivaṭe’’ti āha_, “_Vaṭṭakate_: to show the meaning of this, they say ʻopenʼ.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.17.2": "_Aṅgamaṅgāni_ literally means, “various bodily parts”. The point is perhaps that the wind element caused stiffness throughout the body. [Sp-ṭ.2.74](): _Aṅgamaṅgāni vātupatthaddhāni hontīti evaṃ vuttavātupatthambhena_, “_Aṅgamaṅgāni vātupatthaddhāni honti_: in this way erection due to wind is spoken of.” See _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 1 for the expression _vātupatthambha_. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.23.1": "_Mudhappasannā_ is not directly defined in the commentaries, but we do find indications of its meaning [Sp-ṭ.2.165](): _Balavasaddho hi mandapañño mudhappasanno hoti, avatthusmiṃ pasīdati_, “One who has strong faith and weak wisdom is called _mudhappasanna_. Their confidence is without basis.” "
