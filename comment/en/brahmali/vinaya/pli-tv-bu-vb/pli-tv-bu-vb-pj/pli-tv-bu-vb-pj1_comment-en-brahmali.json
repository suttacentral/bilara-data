  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.19": "The literal meaning is “Good Gotama is disgusted,” but I am taking a bit of literary licence to make it more meaningful and punchy. It may well be that this was implied by the speaker. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.35": "“Retiring” renders _apagabbha_, explained in the commentaries, at Sp 1.10, as: _Gabbhato apagatoti apagabbho_, “_Apagabbha_ means departed from the womb.” However, there is an alternative, and perhaps more convincing, derivation of this word. According to SED, in Vedic Sanskrit we find the word _apagalbha_ in the meaning “wanting in boldness” or “timid”. It seems possible, then, that we here have a play on words, where the brahmin refers to “timid” whereas the Buddha responds according to the meaning “departed from the womb” or “retired from rebirth”. I have used the word “retiring” in an attempt at catching this pun. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1": "“Whiteheads” renders _setaṭṭ(h)ikā_, literally, “white bones”. Sp 4.403: _Setaṭṭhikā nāma rogajātīti eko pāṇako nāḷimajjhagataṁ kaṇḍaṁ vijjhati, yena viddhattā nikkhantampi sālisīsaṁ khīraṁ gahetuṁ na sakkoti_, “The disease called _setaṭṭhikā_ means: an insect penetrates the stem, goes to the middle of the stalk, from the penetration of which the rice grains are not able to get sap.” This seems to be a description of so-called “whiteheads”, pale panicles without rice grains, caused by stem borers. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.10": "“Incapable of doing” renders _setughāta_, literally, “destroyed the bridge”. Sp 1.16: _Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṁ hoti_, “The path is called the bridge. What is said is that there is the destruction and cutting off of such speech by the path.” The commentary seems to take _setu_, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. According to this understanding, the Buddha has cut off access to bad qualities, including bad speech, by fulfilling the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access, that is, the Buddhas no longer have access to what is unbeneficial. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.15": "I have supplied “the problems of famine” from the commentary to bring out the meaning. Sp 1.16: _Dubbhikkhe dullabhapiṇḍe imāya sallahukavuttitāya iminā ca sallekhena vijitaṁ_. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5": "Sp 1.17: _Ettha sādhūti āyācanavacanametaṁ_, “Here this _sādhu_ is expressing a question.” And the same below. _Pappaṭaka_, according to [DN 27](dn27:14.1), is a kind of mushroom. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.18": "Regarding these names, Ven. Shravasti Dhammika of Australia tells me (private communication) the following about the geographical situation of these places: “Verañjā is probably the huge mound at Atranji Khera, about 13 km. north of Etah in Uttar Pradesh; Soreyya is possibly Soron, directly south of Verañjā; Saṅkassa is the modern Sankisa; Kaṇṇakujja is the modern Kannauj; and Payāgapatiṭṭhāna is, as Horner correctly says, Allahabad, recently renamed Prayag, its original name. Except for the uncertain Soreyya, all these places are on a roughly west/east alignment, undoubtedly following the ancient Madhura to Payāga road.” In a subsequent email he clarified that Soron is actually north of Atranjki Khera or Verañjā. Following the modern road network, the total distance from Atranji Khera to Vaishali (Vesālī), according to Google maps, is in excess of 900 kilometers. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:5.6.12": "Sp 1.32: _Idañhi vuttaṁ hoti – “atthi nu kho, tāta sudinna, amhākaṁ dhanaṁ, na mayaṁ niddhanāti”_; “For this is said: ‘Isn’t there, dear Sudinna, our wealth? We are not poor.’” The point, perhaps, is that the father meant to say much more, but was interrupted at the shock of seeing his son eating old porridge. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.2.1": "“Intention of sexual relations” renders _sevanacitta_, literally, “intention of association”. The kind of association applicable to this rule, however, is sexual intercourse. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.1": "“Enemy monks” renders _bhikkhupaccatthikā_, translated as “opponents of monks” by I.B. Horner, which seems to be incorrect. Below we find parallel compounds with other kinds of people, for instance _corapaccatthikā_, which in the context must mean “enemy criminals”, not “enemies of criminals”. Moreover, all these other people would already be accounted for if _bhikkhupaccatthikā_ meant “enemies of monks”. There would be no need to mention them separately. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.2": "That is, he consents to the sexual intercourse at each of these points. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.6.1": "The Pali phrase _aṅgajātena vaccamaggaṁ abhinisīdenti_ could be rendered, “They make (the monk) sit down with his penis in the anus.” Above we find the inverse expression, _vaccamaggena aṅgajātaṁ abhinisīdenti_, which could be rendered, “They make (the woman) sit on his penis with her anus.” The effect is the same, but the agent in the two cases is different. Since the agent is clear from the context, I have rendered the two expressions in the same way. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.7.7.1": "For an explanation of the words _magga_ and _amagga_ as used here, see _magga_ in the Appendix of Technical Terms. In this section, as above, the instrumental case signifies the orifice that is entered. This may seem unusual, but it follows the pattern found elsewhere where the gateway through which anything (such as a house, a village, or a cul-de-sac) is entered is in the instrumental case. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.17.2": "_Aṅgamaṅgāni_ literally means, “various bodily parts”. The point is perhaps that the wind element caused stiffness throughout the body.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.22.2": "“Disrobe” renders _vibbhamissāmi_. According to PED and SED the general meaning of this word is something like “to go astray”. However, the implied meaning throughout the Vinaya Piṭaka is that one leaves the Sangha, that is, one disrobes. I therefore take this word to express the functional equivalence of disrobing. This is supported by the commentaries. Sp 1.435: _Vibbhamantīti ekacce gihī honti_, “_Vibbhamanti_: some became householders.” Sp 4.434: _Yadeva sā vibbhantāti yasmā sā vibbhantā attano ruciyā khantiyā odātāni vatthāni nivatthā, tasmāyeva sā abhikkhunī, na sikkhāpaccakkhānenāti dasseti_, “_Yadeva sā vibbhantā_ means she is no longer a nun because, according to her own preference and choice, she dresses in white.” ",
