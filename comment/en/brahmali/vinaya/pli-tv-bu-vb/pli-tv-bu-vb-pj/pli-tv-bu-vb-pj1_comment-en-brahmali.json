  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.3.35": "“Retiring” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apagabbha</i>, explained in the commentaries, at Sp 1.10, as: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Gabbhato apagatoti apagabbho</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Apagabbha</i> means departed from the womb.” However, there is an alternative, and perhaps more convincing, derivation of this word. According to SED, in Vedic Sanskrit we find the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apagalbha</i> in the meaning “wanting in boldness” or “timid”. It seems possible, then, that we here have a play on words, where the brahmin refers to “timid” whereas the Buddha responds according to the meaning “departed from the womb” or “retired from rebirth”. I have used the word “retiring” in an attempt at catching this pun. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1": "“Whiteheads” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>setaṭṭ(h)ikā</i>, literally, “white bones”. Sp 4.403: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Setaṭṭhikā nāma rogajātīti eko pāṇako nāḷimajjhagataṁ kaṇḍaṁ vijjhati, yena viddhattā nikkhantampi sālisīsaṁ khīraṁ gahetuṁ na sakkoti</i>, “The disease called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>setaṭṭhikā</i> means: an insect penetrates the stem, goes to the middle of the stalk, from the penetration of which the rice grains are not able to get sap.” This seems to be a description of so-called “whiteheads”, pale panicles without rice grains, caused by stem borers.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.10": "“Incapable of doing” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>setughāta</i>, literally, “destroyed the bridge”. Sp 1.16: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṁ hoti</i>, “The path is called the bridge. What is said is that there is the destruction and cutting off of such speech by the path.” The commentary seems to take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>setu</i>, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. According to this understanding, the Buddha has cut off access to bad qualities, including bad speech, by fulfilling the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access, that is, the Buddhas no longer have access to what is unbeneficial. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:4.18": "Regarding these names, Ven. Shravasti Dhammika of Australia tells me (private communication) the following about the geographical situation of these places: “Verañjā is probably the huge mound at Atranji Khera, about 13 km. north of Etah in Uttar Pradesh; Soreyya is possibly Soron, directly south of Verañjā; Saṅkassa is the modern Sankisa; Kaṇṇakujja is the modern Kannauj; and Payāgapatiṭṭhāna is, as Horner correctly says, Allahabad, recently renamed Prayag, its original name. Except for the uncertain Soreyya, all these places are on a roughly west/east alignment, undoubtedly following the ancient Madhura to Payāga road.” In a subsequent email he clarified that Soron is actually north of Atranjki Khera or Verañjā. Following the modern road network, the total distance from Atranji Khera to Vaishali (Vesālī), according to Google maps, is in excess of 900 kilometers. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.1": "“Enemy monks” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>, translated as “opponents of monks” by I.B. Horner, which seems to be incorrect. Below we find parallel compounds with other kinds of people, for instance <i lang='pi' translate='no'>corapaccatthikā</i>, which in the context must mean “enemy criminals”, not “enemies of criminals”.
