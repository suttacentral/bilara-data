According to this understanding, the Buddha has cut off access to bad qualities, including bad speech, by fulfilling the eightfold path.

In later usage, especially in the commentaries, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vihāra</i> comes to refer to entire monasteries, rather than individual dwellings.

In accordance with common usage, “understanding” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭivijānantassa</i>) must refer to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, not to knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener.
