According to this understanding, the Buddha has cut off access to bad qualities, including bad speech, by fulfilling the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access, that is, the Buddhas no longer have access to what is unbeneficial. ",

It is used with permutation series to show a series that does not link back to the first item of a series, that is, it does not form a complete circle or loop, thus being “unconnected”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Khaṇḍa</i> contrasts with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>baddha</i>, which refers to a complete circle, that is, a “linked” permutation series.

In accordance with common usage, “understanding” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭivijānantassa</i>) must refer to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, not to knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener.
