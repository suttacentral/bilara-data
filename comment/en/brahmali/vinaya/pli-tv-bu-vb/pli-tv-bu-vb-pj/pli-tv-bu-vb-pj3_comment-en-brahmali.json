  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.25": "“Yard” renders _pariveṇa_. See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.9": "I have here translated _kāya_ as breath in accordance with the usage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta ([mn118:24.6]()) where the breath is specifically said to be a body among bodies. Sp 1.165: _Sakalassa assāsakāyassa ādimajjhapariyosānaṁ viditaṁ karonto pākaṭaṁ karonto “assasissāmī”ti sikkhati_, “He trains, ‘I will breathe in’, producing knowledge of and familiarity with the beginning, the middle, and the end of the whole body of the breath.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1": "“An instrument of death” renders _satthahāraka_. I follow Richard Gombrich’s interpretation of this word. See “The Mass Suicide of Monks in Discourse and Vinaya Literature”, by Analayo, Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 7: 11–55, 2014. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.3": "Sp 1.176: _Yaṁ uddissa khanati, tassa dukkhuppattiyā thullaccayaṁ, maraṇena pārājikaṁ. Aññasmiṁ patitvā mate anāpatti_, “If the person he dug the pit for experiences pain, there is a serious offense. If he dies, there is an offense entailing expulsion. If someone else falls in and dies, there is no offense.” The commentary makes a point that goes beyond what is found in the Canonical text. According to the Canonical text, if you dig a pit for any human being to fall into, then the offense occurs when any human being falls into it. The commentary, however, makes the additional point that if you dig a pit for a specific human to fall into, you only commit an offense if that same human being falls into it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.5": "Sp 1.176: _Sace anuddissa “yo koci marissatī”ti khato hoti, yattakā patitvā maranti, tattakā pāṇātipātā_, “If it is not dug for a specific person or being, but with the thought, ‘Whatever dies’, then, to the extent that a being falls in and dies, there is killing.” And therefore an offense entailing expulsion if that being is human. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.9": "Kkh-pṭ: _Manussaviggaho nāgasupaṇṇādisadiso tiracchānagato tiracchānagatamanussaviggaho_, “_Tiracchānagatamanussaviggaha_: an animal like a dragon or a _garuda_, etc., in human form.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.8.2": "“Syrup” renders _phāṇita_ I.B. Horner instead translates it as “molasses”, which doesn’t quite hit the mark. SED defines _phāṇita_ as “the inspissated juice of the sugar cane or other plants”, in other words, “cane syrup”. According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.8": "Sp-ṭ 1.180: _Udukkhalabhaṇḍikanti udukkhalatthāya ānītaṁ dārubhaṇḍaṁ_, “_Udukkhalabhaṇḍika_: wooden goods brought for the sake of a mortar.” That _akkamati_ can mean “kick” can be seen from [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.20.9](): _Aññatarā itthī passitvā aṅgajāte abhinisīdi_, “The monk kicked her off.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.4.2": "“For a certain event” is not found in the Pali, but has been added to make the Pali idiom clearer. Sp 2.108: _Kāle ārociteti yāgubhattādīsu yassa kassaci kāle ārocite_, “_Kāle ārocite_: when the time is announced for whatever, such as rice porridge, a meal, etc.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.7.10": "This is to be expanded as in segments 5.5.7–5.5.19 above. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.13.1": "The Pali seem to say that he simply fell off the cliff, _papatanto_, but the context seems to require something more deliberate. Perhaps it is just an idiom. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.18.22": "It is not an offense entailing expulsion because he was aiming to kill the child, not the mother. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.23.1": "The text doesn’t say what the legal procedure, the _(saṅgha-)kamma_, was about, but it seems implied that it was against that monk. This is also the position of the sub-commentary at Sp-ṭ 1.187: _Kammādhippāyāti tajjanīyādikammakaraṇādhippāyā_, “Aiming at a legal procedure: aiming at doing a legal procedure of censure, etc.” The monks from the group of seventeen were in regular conflict with the monks from the group of six.
