If someone else falls in and dies, there is no offense.” The commentary makes a point that goes beyond what is found in the Canonical text. According to the Canonical text, if you dig a pit for any human being to fall into, then the offense occurs when any human being falls into it. The commentary, however, makes the additional point that if you dig a pit for a specific human to fall into, you only commit an offense if that same human being falls into it. ",

According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”. ",
