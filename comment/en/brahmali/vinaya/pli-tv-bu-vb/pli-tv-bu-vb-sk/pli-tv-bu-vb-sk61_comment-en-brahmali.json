  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk61:1.5": "[Sp.2.638](): _Akkantassāti chattadaṇḍake aṅgulantaraṃ appavesetvā kevalaṃ pādukaṃ akkamitvā ṭhitassa. Paṭimukkassāti paṭimuñcitvā ṭhitassa. Upāhanāyapi eseva nayo. Omukkoti panettha paṇhikabaddhaṃ omuñcitvā ṭhito vuccati_, “_Akkantassa_: not having entered the toes into the _chattadaṇḍaka_, he stands on top of the entire shoe. _Paṭimukkassa_: he stands after fastening. But here, standing after loosening the heel strap, it is called _omukka_.” It is not clear what a _chattadaṇḍaka_, literally, “a sunshade rib”, means in this context. Perhaps it refers to the thong that goes between the toes. "
