  "sn35.80:3.1": "This will inevitably be the most controversial thing I propose - using the term 'system' as a translation of 'Dhamma'. The word is extremely common, so it's more comfortable to translate it as \"thing\". But \"system\" is the trending term in 20th-21st century parlance to refer to something that exists dependently. At least in some cases, using that translation will help preserve the nuance that Dhamma refers to dependent-related phenomena. If it's too laborious to read, I may use that translation more sparingly ",
  "sn35.80:6.2": "This sutta is an echo of SN35.23 \"The All\". And the phrase \"sabbe dhammƒÅ\" is in the Samyutta Agama 319-321 as a specific phrase. So I don't want to lose that association by translating this simply as \"nothing\" or \"all things\"."
