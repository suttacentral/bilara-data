This is the first time that this classic of 20th century Buddhist scholarship has been made available in a true digital edition. We are able to do this because the <a href='http://www.palitext.com/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Pali Text Society</a>, holders of the copyright, kindly released the text under a <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0</a> licence.",
  "downloads:8": "SuttaCentral exists to present the Buddhist texts, not people’s opinions about the texts, so our policy is to exclude introductions, footnotes, and the like. On SuttaCentral, therefore, we have only the translated text itself. However, in this case we felt that the scholarly apparatus was valuable enough to put the considerable effort into creating a proper digital edition of the entire text. This is what we offer in these downloads. These are, of course, covered by the same Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 licence. The text is presented in a number of formats, which are explained below.",
  "downloads:9": "Further details on the process of creating these texts and on relevant changes are included in the Preface to the SuttaCentral edition. All versions include such enhancements as clickable links for over 12,000 internal references, detailed tables of contents, and revised reference system.",
