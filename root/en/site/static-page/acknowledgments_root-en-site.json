  "acknowledgments:12": "In late 2012 we began a new redesign, with the core team being Rod Bucknell, John Kelly, and Bhante Sujato. This was originally spurred by John Kelly’s work assisting Bhikkhu Bodhi on the Aṅguttara Nikāya translation, which resulted in a number of new parallels being discovered. However we decided to go beyond just making some additions, and have embarked on a complete redesign. While the data structure has been retained with only incremental improvements, the entire code for the website has been rewritten. For this new edition, the main team is as follows.",

  "acknowledgments:22": "While the 2012 rebuild has served us well, we have seen the need for a systematic upgrade. We have made a series of incremental changes, each one of which must be added to the original structure somehow, and things get a bit creaky after a while. At a certain point it’s better to rebuild in a cleaner and more systematic way. We embarked on this process in 2017. Key underlying changes include internationalization, integration of Sutta, Vinaya, and verse parallels, and addition of segmented translations. The core development team for this process has been as follows.",
