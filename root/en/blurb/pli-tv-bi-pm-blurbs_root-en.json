The exact meaning of the Pali word is disputed, but there is no doubt that it refers to expulsion from the monastic Order. There are eight such rules for the nuns, four of which are shared with the monks. Anyone who breaches any of these rules immediately loses her status as a nun. She is expelled from the Order and ineligible for re-ordination for the rest of her life. The _pārājikas_, together with the next category of rules, the _saṅghādisesas_, are collectively known as serious offenses, _garukāpatti_.

The exact meaning of the Pali word is disputed, but according to the commentary it means that the Order (_saṅgha_) is required at the beginning (_ādi_) and for the rest (_sesa_) of the procedure. There are seventeen such rules for the nuns, seven of which are shared with the monks. Anyone who breaches any of these rules is to be suspended from the monastic Order. The offender must go through a process of rehabilitation called _mānatta_, “trial period,” lasting half a month. During the rehabilitation period the offending nun loses her normal status and is required to follow a number of special provisions, such as not staying in the same room as a regular nun and not going anywhere by herself. When the rehabilitation process has been completed, an Order of twenty nuns is required to formally rehabilitate the offender. She then regains her full status as a nun. The _saṅghādisesas_ and the _pārājikas_ are collectively known as serious offenses, _garukāpatti_.

These rules, together with all the other rules apart from those entailing expulsion and suspension, are classed as light offenses, _lahukāpatti_. For light offenses there is no penalty apart from confession. What distinguishes these rules from the _pācittiyas_ is the manner of confession, which is done using a unique formula. These eight rules for the nuns are equivalent to a single rule for the monks (_bhikkhu_ _pācittiya_ 39). In summary they say that a nun who asks for special food must acknowledge the offense.",
  "pli-tv-bi-pm-blurbs:pli-tv-bi-pm-sk": "The rules in this category are known in Pali as _sekhiya_, “involving training.” There are seventy-five such rules, and they are the same both for the nuns and the monks. These rules, together with all the other rules apart from those entailing expulsion and suspension, are classed as light offenses, _lahukāpatti_. For light offenses there is no penalty apart from confession. What distinguishes these rules from the other light offenses is that there is no transgression unless the offender is acting out of disrespect for the rule. The _sekhiyas_ are rules of etiquette and as such are often tightly bound to the norms that prevailed in ancient India. Because of temporal and geographical separation from the society in which these rules were established, many of these rules are now obsolete. The rules are too short to merit individual treatment here.",
  "pli-tv-bi-pm-blurbs:pli-tv-bi-pm-as": "The rules in this category are known in Pali as _adhikaraṇasamathadhamma_, “principles for the settling of legal issues.” There are seven such principles, and they are the same both for the nuns and the monks. These principles are not rules in the ordinary sense and as such fall outside of the classification into serious and light offenses. Instead, they set out the proper methods for dealing with legal issues. The monastic code and its analysis include only a brief expression of each of these principles, with the detailed exposition on how to apply them found in the _Samathakkhandhaka_. The legal issues to be settled through these principles fall into four categories: disputes, accusations, offenses, and proceedings. These categories include all legal issues that may arise within a monastic institution. The last of the four, proceedings, include monastic procedures such as ordination and the keeping of the observance day, the _uposatha_.",

  "pli-tv-bi-pm-blurbs:pli-tv-bi-vb": "The _bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga_ (“the analysis of the nuns’ rules”) contains the monastic code for nuns, the _bhikkhunī-pātimokkha_, embedded in explanatory material. The _bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga_ is divided into seven chapters, each dealing with a separate class of rules, grouped according to the offense incurred in breaking them, with the exception of the _adhikaraṇasamathadhamma_ (“the principles for resolving legal issues”), which are principles to be applied rather than rules in the strict sense. Each rule together with its explanatory material forms an independent unit, a sub-chapter. These units begin with one or more origin stories, which tell the circumstances that led the Buddha to lay down a particular rule. The rule is then stated, followed by a word commentary that analyzes every significant word contained in the rule. After the word commentary follows a permutation series in which a variety of different scenarios are evaluated and offenses assigned as appropriate. At the end comes a non-offense clause, stating important exceptions to the rule, sometimes followed by individual case studies, in which the Buddha decides the offense incurred in ambiguous cases.",
  "pli-tv-bi-pm-blurbs:pli-tv-bi-vb-pj": "The rules in this category are known in Pali as _pārājika_. The exact meaning of the Pali word is disputed, but there is no doubt that it refers to expulsion from the monastic Order. There are eight such rules for the nuns, four of which are shared with the monks. Anyone who breaches any of these rules immediately loses her status as a nun. She is expelled from the Order and ineligible for re-ordination for the rest of her life. The _pārājikas_, together with the next category of rules, the _saṅghādisesas_, are collectively known as serious offenses, _garukāpatti_. These rules are the most fundamental ones for the proper living of the monastic life."
