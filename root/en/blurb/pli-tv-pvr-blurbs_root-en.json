  "pli-tv-pvr-blurbs:pli-tv-pvr": "<p>The <i>Parivāra</i>, “the Compendium,” is a technical analysis of the content of the <i>Suttavibhaṅga</i> and the <i>Khandhakas</i>. It summarizes and distils the essence of the Vinaya, leaving out all narratives and stories. One example of its approach is an Aṅguttara-nikāya style chapter, where aspects of the Vinaya are summarized in bare numerical lists. Towards the end of the <i>Parivāra</i> we find a chapter entertainingly named the Sedamocakagāthā, “the Sweat-inducing verses,” which consists of a series of difficult riddles to be solved by advanced students of the monastic law.</p><p>The <i>Parivāra</i> is unique to the Theravada school and it is probable that it was compiled in the sectarian period. Its manner of analysis shares certain characteristics with the Abhidhamma, such as expanding and filling in schemes of classification not given in full detail in the other Canonical texts. One example is the <i>Parivāra’s</i> exposition of the “sources of offenses,” āpattisamuṭṭhāna, for each individual rule, with only a general scheme found in the rest of the Vinaya. The similarity of approach with the Abhidhamma could indicate that they stem from roughly from the same period. Two references to writing also suggests a relatively late composition for this work.</p>"
