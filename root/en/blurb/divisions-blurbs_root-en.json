  "divisions-blurbs:kn": "The word <i>khuddaka</i> means “lesser” or “minor”, and it seems that this category originally served to collect certain short collections, mostly verse, that were not conveniently assigned to one of the main <i>nikāyas</i>. Over time, however, the collection grew, so that the Khuddaka in the Pali canon today is the largest of the <i>nikāyas</i>. It includes some of the most popular texts in Theravāda Buddhism, such as the Dhammapada, the Sutta Nipāta, and the Jātakas. There is no closely parallel collection in the other canons, but many of the early texts have parallels in various places.",

The <i>udāna<i> and <i>dhammapada</i> literature appear to overlap, and can be considered as one genre. The Dhammapada verses also have associated narratives, but these are found in the commentary.

Alone among Buddhist texts, its survival is attributed not to the Saṅgha, but to a laywoman named Khujjuttarā. According to the Pali commentaries, she was a maid to the Queen of Kosambi, and memorized these teachings from the Buddha, earning her the title of the most learned of the laywomen disciples.",

This contains some of the most beloved texts in popular Buddhism, such as the Ratana, Maṅgala, and Mettā Suttas, which are known to all Theravada Buddhists and recited as uplifting and protective chants at auspicious ceremonies. The collection as a whole is somewhat late; it is not found in northern scriptures, and some portions, such as the opening verses of the Nālaka Sutta, belong to the latest strata of the early texts. Nevertheless, certain sections—the “Rhinoceros Horn”, the “Chapter of the Eights”, and the “Way to the Beyond”—appear to have existed before being gathered into the collection, and are regarded as early.

Together these collections constitute one of the oldest and largest collections of contemplative literature, preserving the unique voices of hundreds of early practitioners. Based on style and content, these collections belong to the early discourses. They are referred to on occasion in the northern canons, but no parallel collections have survived.",

The Therīgāthā is one of the oldest spiritual texts recording only women’s voices. It is a pair with the Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”.

They are referred to on occasion in the northern canons, but no parallel collections have survived.",
  "divisions-blurbs:ja": "A collection of 547 sets of verses telling stories of the Buddha’s past lives. The canonical Pali collection consists of verses arranged in numbered sets in the Aṅguttara fashion. The shorter sets illustrate a high point of a story, while the longer sets tell a complete story. These verses would have been passed down from the beginning with prose narrative to flesh out the story, which in the Pali is now found in the commentary. It is in the commentary that we find the explicit connection between the stories of the past and the present day, identifying the hero of the tale with the <i>bodhisattva</i> and the major protagonists with the Buddha’s contemporaries. This collection is the main source of Jātakas, but there are many similar stories found elsewhere in the Pali canon (a few in the four <i>nikāyas</i>, others in the Cariyapiṭaka) and throughout the Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit texts. Most of the Jātakas began life as folk tales or myths, drops from the vast ocean of story in oral culture. Several Jātakas record versions of famous Hindu myths, while others share a common basis with European folk tales. The verse forms in the Jātakas are mostly of the earlier kinds, and the social and political reflect historical realities in the centuries before the Buddha, where, for example, Varanasi was an independent kingdom. The Jātakas are the oldest, largest, and best-preserved collection of ancient stories found anywhere in the world. One of the central themes is renunciation, with multiple stories depicting the hero going-forth from the home, each time from a different perspective. Jātakas generally illustrate moral messages, but since the hero is supposed to be imperfect, it is not unusual for him to be portrayed as making dubious choices, even breaking precepts. Taken as a whole, the Jātaka literature is a vast tapestry of story illustrating the twisting and uncertain path to Awakening. The Jātaka genre proved a popular and effective framework for incorporating popular tales into a Buddhist context. They feature prominently in Buddhist art both ancient and modern, and are a primary means of introducing Buddhism to children in modern Theravāda.",

However, it does not make use of the main Abhidhamma <i>mātikās</i>. This text introduces a number of terms and ideas of great importance in later Buddhist philosophy.

  "divisions-blurbs:mil": "The Milindapañha or “Questions of King Milinda” records a series of discussions on points of Dhamma between the monk Nāgasena and the Greek king known as in Pali as Milinda. He is usually identified with Menander I Soter, who ruled an Indo-Greek kingdom from his capital of Sagala around BCE 165–130. While the encounter between Greek and Indian culture is fascinating, the dialogs concern only interpretation of Buddhist ideas, with which the king was evidently very familiar, and does not mention Greek philosophy. The text is lively and dynamic, with the King constantly testing Nāgasena with abstruse questions, to which he responds with ingenious arguments and analogies. The text has a shorter Chinese counterpart in the Nāgasena Bhikṣu Sūtra. The text is not Theravādin in origin, but began among one of the schools in the north-west, perhaps the Sarvāstivādins. Most of the content, however, is not sectarian in nature. The Pali text has been extended over the years, and in addition, portions appear to be missing.
