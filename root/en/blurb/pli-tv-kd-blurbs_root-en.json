  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd1": "The Mahākhandhaka, “the Great chapter”, begins by telling the story of the Buddha after his awakening. Three of the Buddha’s first and most well-known discourses—the Setting in motion of the wheel of the Teaching, the Characteristics of non-self, and the Discourse on fire—are given in full. As he starts to accumulate disciples, an ordination procedure gradually evolves. A large number of rules that concern ordination, especially about the eligibility of the candidate, are laid down, as are rules governing the relationship between teacher and student, including rules about novices.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd2": "The Uposathakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the observance day”, lays down the rules concerning the twice-monthly observance day, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uposatha</i>, which is kept on the day of the full moon and the new moon. It is on these days that the main rules binding on all monastics, the Monastic Code or the Pātimokkha, is recited. The chapter also gives the rules regarding the boundary, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sīmā</i>, that defines the extent of a single monastic community. Rules on making amends for offenses are also found here.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd3": "The Vassūpanāyikakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on entering the rainy-season residence”, prohibits monastics from traveling during three months of the rainy season. Instead they should enter the rainy-season residence in a suitable place. It then gives a number of exemptions because of which a monastic may travel for a maximum of seven days to look after urgent business.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd4": "The Pavāraṇākhandhaka, “the Chapter on the invitation ceremony”, concerns the rules that apply to the ceremony of inviting correction from one’s fellow monastics.

The chapter includes the inspiring stories of the monk Soṇa Koḷivisa who was the Buddha’s foremost disciple in putting forth energy and the monk Soṇa Kuṭikaṇṇa who became a monk in the distant country of Avantī where Buddhism had barely arrived. It also mentions a number of rules that are relaxed for lands outside of the middle Ganges plain.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd6": "The Bhesajjakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on medicines”, concerns allowable medicines and medical treatment. The rules laid down here include prohibitions against various kinds of meat and against cooking by monastics. The chapter contains the remarkable story of the monk Pilindavaccha and his supernormal powers. It also features the stories of the courtesan Ambapālī offering her mango grove to the Sangha, the conversion of general Sīha, and the exceptional layman Meṇḍaka, after whom the Meṇḍaka allowance is named. This allowance enables lay supporters to deposit a fund with a steward, who is to be approached by a designated monastic in need of requisites. The chapter concludes with four general standards to help monastics decide what is and what is not allowable.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd7": "The Kathinakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on the robe-making ceremony”, describes the procedure and rules for the robe-making ceremony that is normally held in the last month of the rainy season, after the rainy-season residence has been completed.

  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd10": "The Kosambakakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on those from Kosambī”, discusses how to deal with a split in the Sangha. The chapter begins with the story of “the Kosambī incident”, which led to a serious dispute and spilt in the Sangha. The Buddha tells the story of Dīghāvu, a longer version of the Kosambiya Jātaka of the Jātaka collection, in an attempt at getting the monks to come to their senses. Failing at this, he goes to visit the three friends Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila, who exemplify the art of living in harmony.",

  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd15": "The Khuddakavatthukkhandhaka, “the Chapter with short topics”, contains a large and diverse number of minor rules, including rules on allowable buildings. A recurrent theme is that luxurious items and sensual indulgence are not allowed. The verses to protect against dangerous insects and snakes, the so-called Khandhaparitta, are found here.

The story continues with Devadatta’s ambition to lead the Sangha—including the story of King Ajātasattu murdering his father and Devadatta’s attempts to kill the Buddha—his actions eventually resulting in schism. As part of this the Buddha lays down an “announcement procedure”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pakāsanīyakamma</i>, by which the Sangha can distance itself from the actions of any particular individual. The chapter concludes with a technical discussion on schism.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd18": "The Vattakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on conduct”, lays down the rules of conduct that apply in a variety of circumstances, such as those between teacher and student; those for visiting, resident, and departing monastics; those for alms-round and forest dwelling; those for dining halls, dwellings, restrooms, and saunas.",
