<h1>Preface to the Itivuttaka</h1>
<p>For the slightest of the early Buddhist books, I feel I should write a slight preface. There is beauty in simplicity and strength in humility. Spiritual teachings need not always tell us something new, nor need they dazzle us with complicated philosophy or intricate arguments. Sometimes the most powerful lesson is that which you have always known.</p>
<p>It is a discomforting thought, but when I think of those who most effortlessly embody the Buddhaâ€™s teachings, it is rarely those who have mastered the scriptures or who debate the meaning of abstruse points. It is in the simple offering, the quiet devotion, the humble wisdom, the unnoticed kindness that I see the flowering of grace.</p>
<p>To be all that we can be is to be less than we have become. If all that the suttas did was to fill us with information, they would be as useful as an ancient Wikipedia (which would be no bad thing). The real wisdom of the suttas, I have come to learn, lies in their delicate balance: saying what need be said and not saying what need not be said.</p>
<p>A full meal is best enjoyed on an empty stomach. And the suttas will fill our minds and hearts, but only if we respect their empty spaces.</p>
