<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>In 2009 Brian Ashen, the then-president of the Federation of Australia Buddhist Councils, toured the Federal Parliament of Australia in Canberra. The tour was shown the Despatch Box, which contained sacred scriptures when required for oath-taking. This box, which sits in a place of honor before the Prime Minister, contained a Bible and a Quran.</p>
<p>Brian raised this with the FABC and we agreed to propose a Buddhist scripture to be placed alongside the scriptures of Christianity and Islam. Unfortunately, the Tipiṭaka is large, even more so if we consider the canons of all schools. So we needed to suggest a single text that would well represent all the Buddhist traditions.</p>
<p>I proposed the Dhammapada. Here is an edited excerpt from my proposal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dhammapada is one of the ancient texts, spoken, as far as we can tell, largely by the historical Buddha, and organized and edited by the Sangha of old. We cannot know, of course, that all of the verses were spoken as we have them by the Buddha himself, and indeed several of them share things in common with Jain or Brahmanical verses. Nevertheless, as a historical scholar, I feel that the teachings found there are very likely to represent the actual teachings of Siddhattha.</p>
<p>The Dhammapada is not a sectarian document. It is true that the best-known version, which I have proposed for inclusion, stems from the Theravada school, but this is just an accident of history. This particular version happened to have been passed down through the Sri Lankan lineage. But many other versions have come down to us.</p>
<p>There are no significant doctrinal differences between these versions. They merely choose slightly different readings, some different verses, and change the order. It would be a nice gesture to non-sectarianism to include one of these texts as well as or instead of the Pali, but I am not aware of any suitable translations.</p>
<p>The teachings found in the Dhammapada are those common to all schools. They are particularly relevant for lay instruction and are frequently used in that way in Buddhist communities. But perhaps even more significant, the Dhammapadas are often associated by scholars with “Ashokan Buddhism”. That is to say, the emphasis on a practical application of Dhamma to a good life as found in the Dhammapada, and especially the emphasis on non-violence, relates very closely to the teachings found in the Ashokan edicts. This means that they are particularly suitable for a leader who seeks moral and spiritual guidance in the practicalities of life.</p>
<p>Can we imagine, what would a politician do if she happened, on a difficult night in Parliament, to seek some solace from the religious texts found there? She opens the box, is delighted to see a Buddhist text, and, having heard that Buddhism is a rational religion of ethics and meditation, opens a random page. What does she find?</p>
<p><em>Hatred is never appeased by hatred, hatred is only ever appeased by love: this is an ancient law.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Happily, my proposal was accepted. We approached the Pali Text Society, who kindly donated a hardcover edition of K.R. Norman’s excellent analytical translation. And on the 15th of September 2009, I was proud to be part of the Buddhist delegation that met with the Speaker of the House, who accepted our copy of the Dhammapada and placed it in the Despatch Box, where it remains to this day.</p>
