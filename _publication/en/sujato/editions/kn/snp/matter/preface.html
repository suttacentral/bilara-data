<h1>Preface to the Suttanipāta</h1>
<p>In case it’s not obvious from the Introduction, I really love the Suttanipāta. When I was a young monk I tried to memorize it. I didn’t succeed, but I got more than halfway through before life intervened. It’s been my friend and teacher for half my life.</p>
<p>At times, I have to admit, it has been a difficult relationship. The Suttanipāta can be stubborn, refusing to give up its secrets. Even after a quarter century of study, and with the assistance of so much great scholarship, it wasn’t until I translated it that I felt I got certain passages. And then, when I wrote the Introduction, it was only <em>then</em> that I got it. I’ll probably be “getting it” for quite some time to come.</p>
<p>Scripture is nor like the news, nor like a novel or a tweet. It stays with you. It gets into your bones. It sinks into them and stays there. Words and phrases turn up when you least expect them. Perspectives and resonances shape how you see the world. When you learn scripture, you might forget some things, but you never unlearn them.</p>
<p>When I was finishing up my Introduction, I asked myself what I probably should have asked at the start: who is this for? It’s too long and complicated for a general reader, too Buddhist for academics, too wide-ranging for meditators. There’s too much historical stuff; it’s not relevant enough.</p>
<p>I was thinking about the texts mentioned by Ashoka, and it occurs to me that scholars have spilled considerable ink to identify the texts without noticing perhaps the most relevant detail. He mentions the discourses on the “fears of the future”. For him, living over a century later, the Buddha’s future was his present. He looked to those texts because they were relevant. And this is the beginning of a long history of reading Suttas based on “what is relevant for me”.</p>
<p>So who is my Introduction for? I guess it must be for me. It’s what I would have wanted to read when starting out. If it’s not for you, maybe one day you’ll write your own. Until then, may you enjoy your journey.</p>
