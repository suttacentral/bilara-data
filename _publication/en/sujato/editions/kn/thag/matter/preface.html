<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>The monks of the Theragāthā are my brothers. I can feel them through the years, their struggles and triumphs, their deep joys and nagging sorrows. They are also my idols, those humans who I would most like to be. </p>
<p>The Buddha’s teachings are amazing. But it is not about the philosophy, it is about the people, about what mattered to them and what matters to us. In their fierce forests, their leaf huts, their tattered robes, the monks of old could not be more different than us.</p>
<p>Except in another way they are just like us. For the comforts of our civilization are but a veneer, a veil between us and the world as it has been lived by humans for thousands of years. How is it that when we look into our heart of hearts we yearn only to be free, and when we hear the words of people in such distant times and places, we find the same yearning?</p>
<p>To renounce is to dedicate one’s life to having less. For we who have taken the mendicant path, having things is a hassle, and having no things is freedom. It is strange to look at the world of consumerism and see how people have fought so hard for such a long time for the freedom to live their lives, to make their own choices, to be who they want to be. And what do they choose? To trap themselves in the plastic prison of their desires? To insist on getting what they want while giving not a single thought to wanting wisely? </p>
<p>We shall leave all of this behind. We might as well start now.</p>
