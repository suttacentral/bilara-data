<p>Seclusion is happiness for the contented <br>who see the teaching they have learned. <br>Kindness for the world is happiness <br>for one who’d not harm a living creature.</p>
<p>Dispassion for the world is happiness <br>for one who has gone beyond sensual pleasures. <br>But dispelling the conceit ʻI am’ <br>is truly the ultimate happiness.</p>
