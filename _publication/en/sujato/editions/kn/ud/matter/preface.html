<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>Joy is the most underrated emotion. Joy or rejoicing or celebration is <i lang='pli' translate='no'>muditā</i> in Pali, one of the four “meditations of Brahmā” (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>brahmavihāra</i>). At one point, I wanted to translate it as “pride”, not in the sense of “vanity” but in “taking pleasure in the accomplishments of oneself or others”. I didn’t go ahead with that, but I still think about it. It is the dual aspect of “pride” that interests me.</p>
<p>For many years, philosophers in the Christian traditions taught that pride was the greatest of sins, tantamount to imagining oneself as God. But for Buddhists, that is precisely the point. <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Muditā</i> does lead to becoming God, or Brahmā as the ancient Indians called them. For that is ultimately what the four “meditations of Brahmā” are: what God did that made them become God. Any one of us can do the same thing and become God in our own right—if that is what we want.</p>
<p>I’m proud of the work that I’ve achieved in the suttas. It makes me happy to think about it. It gives me confidence and assurance when I hear that others have found joy in my work too. And in my meditation, that joy lifts me and sustains me. It is purely wholesome and leads only to freedom.</p>
<p>I want others to feel that same joy. This glorious tradition belongs to all of us. We all have something to offer, so let us honor our tradition with our time and love and intelligence.</p>
