<h1>Preface to the Therīgāthā</h1>
<p>While writing the introduction for this book, I found myself reflecting on my approach to the analysis of texts. I find myself increasingly put off by heavily theoretical approaches, or by analyses that invent a scheme of categorization into which the texts must fall. When teaching the Suttas, my approach is pretty much the same as it is when reading them: open the book and start reading. Listen to what it is actually saying.</p>
<p>The key is empathy and critical discernment. I never assume that I am in a position of moral authority from which to judge people of another time and place. I’m here to learn, not to condemn. And the further people are away from me, the more I have to learn from them.</p>
<p>To me, a genuine inquiry begins with the willingness to question my values and assumptions. But over the years, I have picked up one or two things that might be useful for others. So if, as a writer and a teacher, I can clarify some facts, smooth the path, and set an example of an honest inquiry, I’ll be happy.</p>
<p>When teaching Suttas, I’ve noticed two biasses that obscure vision. For some folks, the process of reading is an entirely passive venture, in which their only concern is to find the single, correct, and authoritative meaning. For others, their subjective feelings or theories about the text are paramount, and they feel good when they succeed in squeezing an ancient sacred text into their preconceptions. </p>
<p>Both approaches are lazy and far from wisdom. Understanding arises when you see the hidden connections between distant things. It’s not about passing a test or proving your ideological purity. It’s about that moment when you <em>see</em>. You can’t control it or predict it. </p>
<p>Getting your facts straight is important. It takes discipline and years of hard work to learn how to sift out one’s views and to listen with clarity and empathy. It’s crucial to do the work to ground opinions on the facts, for uninformed opinions are worth less than nothing. </p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. The meaning of those facts is something else entirely. And in a sacred text, meaning is never exhausted. May it deepen and grow with you on your journey. </p>
