<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.</p>
<p>Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of translation, I have frequently sought feedback and suggestions from the community on the SuttaCentral community on our forum, “Discuss and Discover”. I want to thank all those who have made suggestions and contributed to my understanding, as well as to the moderators who have made the forum possible. These translations were significantly improved due to the careful work of my proofreaders: Ayyā Pāsādā, John and Lynn Kelly, and Derek Sola. Special thanks are due to Sabbamittā, a true friend of all, who has tirelessly and precisely checked my work.</p>
<p>Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.</p>
