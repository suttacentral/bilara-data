  "sn36.8:2.1": "“Mendicants, a mendicant should await their time mindful and aware. ",
  "sn36.8:2.2": "This is my instruction to you. ",
  "sn36.8:3.1": "And how is a mendicant mindful? ",
  "sn36.8:3.2": "It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",

  "sn36.8:4.2": "It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

  "sn36.8:5.5": "Dependent on what? ",
  "sn36.8:5.6": "Dependent on this very contact. ",
  "sn36.8:5.7": "But this contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated. ",
