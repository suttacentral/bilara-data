  "sn2.26:3.1": "Once upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic power. ",
  "sn2.26:3.2": "I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. ",

  "sn2.26:3.6": "Having such speed and stride, I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world. ",
