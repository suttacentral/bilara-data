  "sn47.10:2.1": "“Sir, Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” ",

  "sn47.10:8.2": "Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ ",
  "sn47.10:8.3": "And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ ",
