  "sn4.24:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "sn4.24:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. ",
  "sn4.24:1.3": "Now at that time Māra the Wicked had been following the Buddha for seven years hoping to find a vulnerability without success. ",
  "sn4.24:1.4": "Then Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha and addressed him in verse: ",
  "sn4.24:2.1": "“Are you swamped by sorrow that you meditate in the forest? ",
  "sn4.24:2.2": "Have you lost a fortune, or do you long for one? ",
  "sn4.24:2.3": "Or perhaps you’ve committed some crime in the village? ",
  "sn4.24:2.4": "Why don’t you get too close to people? ",
  "sn4.24:2.5": "And why does no-one get close to you?” ",
  "sn4.24:3.1": "“I’ve dug out the root of sorrow completely. ",
  "sn4.24:3.2": "I practice absorption free of guilt or sorrow. ",
  "sn4.24:3.3": "I’ve cut off all greed and hunger for future lives. ",
  "sn4.24:3.4": "Undefiled, I practice absorption, O kinsman of the negligent!” ",
  "sn4.24:4.1": "“The things they call ‘mine’, ",
  "sn4.24:4.2": "and those who say ‘it’s mine’: ",
  "sn4.24:4.3": "if your mind remains there, ",
  "sn4.24:4.4": "you won’t escape me, ascetic!” ",
  "sn4.24:5.1": "“The things they speak of aren’t mine; ",
  "sn4.24:5.2": "I’m not someone who speaks like that. ",
  "sn4.24:5.3": "So know this, Wicked One: ",
  "sn4.24:5.4": "you won’t even see the path I take.” ",
  "sn4.24:6.1": "“If you’ve discovered the path ",
  "sn4.24:6.2": "that’s safe, and leads to the deathless, ",
  "sn4.24:6.3": "go and walk that path alone—",
  "sn4.24:6.4": "why teach it to anyone else?” ",
  "sn4.24:7.1": "“Those crossing to the far shore ",
  "sn4.24:7.2": "ask what’s beyond the domain of Death. ",
  "sn4.24:7.3": "When I’m asked, I explain to them ",
  "sn4.24:7.4": "the truth without attachments.” ",
  "sn4.24:8.1": "“Sir, suppose there was a lotus pond not far from a town or village, ",
  "sn4.24:8.2": "and a crab lived there. ",
  "sn4.24:8.3": "Then several boys or girls would leave the town or village and go to the pond, where they’d pull out the crab and put it on dry land. ",
  "sn4.24:8.4": "Whenever that crab extended a claw, those boys or girls would snap, crack, and break it off with a stick or a stone. ",
  "sn4.24:8.5": "And when that crab’s claws had all been snapped, cracked, and broken off it wouldn’t be able to return down into that lotus pond. ",
  "sn4.24:8.6": "In the same way, sir, the Buddha has snapped, cracked, and broken off all my tricks, dodges, and evasions. ",
  "sn4.24:8.7": "Now I’m not able to approach the Buddha again in hopes of finding a vulnerability.” ",
  "sn4.24:8.8": "Then Māra the Wicked recited these verses of disappointment in the Buddha’s presence: ",
  "sn4.24:9.1": "“A crow once circled a stone ",
  "sn4.24:9.2": "that looked like a lump of fat. ",
  "sn4.24:9.3": "‘Perhaps I’ll find something tender,’ it thought, ",
  "sn4.24:9.4": "‘perhaps there’s something tasty.’ ",
  "sn4.24:10.1": "But it didn’t find anything tasty, ",
  "sn4.24:10.2": "so the crow left that place. ",
  "sn4.24:10.3": "Like the crow that pecked the stone, ",
  "sn4.24:10.4": "I leave Gotama disappointed.”"
