  "sn35.69:1.1": "At one time the venerables Sāriputta and Upasena were staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Wood, under the Snake’s Hood Grotto. ",
  "sn35.69:1.2": "Now at that time a viper fell on Upasena’s body, ",
  "sn35.69:1.3": "and he addressed the mendicants, ",
  "sn35.69:1.4": "“Come, reverends, lift this body onto a cot and carry it outside ",
  "sn35.69:1.5": "before it’s scattered right here ",
  "sn35.69:1.6": "like a handful of chaff.” ",
  "sn35.69:2.1": "When he said this, Sāriputta said to him, ",
  "sn35.69:2.2": "“But we don’t see any impairment in your body or deterioration of your faculties. ",
  "sn35.69:2.3": "Yet you say: ",
  "sn35.69:2.4": "‘Come, reverends, lift this body onto a cot and carry it outside ",
  "sn35.69:2.5": "before it’s scattered right here ",
  "sn35.69:2.6": "like a handful of chaff.’” ",
  "sn35.69:2.7": "“Reverend Sāriputta, there may be an impairment in body or deterioration of faculties for someone who thinks: ",
  "sn35.69:2.8": "‘I am the eye’ or ‘the eye is mine.’ ",
  "sn35.69:2.9": "Or ‘I am the ear … nose … tongue … body …’ ",

  "sn35.69:2.14": " ",
  "sn35.69:2.15": " ",
  "sn35.69:2.16": "So why would there be an impairment in my body or deterioration of my faculties?” ",
  "sn35.69:3.1": "“That must be because Venerable Upasena has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit. ",
  "sn35.69:3.2": "That’s why it doesn’t occur to you: ",
  "sn35.69:3.3": "‘I am the eye’ or ‘the eye is mine.’ Or ‘I am the ear … ",
  "sn35.69:3.4": "nose … tongue … body …’ ",
  "sn35.69:3.5": "Or ‘I am the mind’ or ‘the mind is mine.’” ",
  "sn35.69:3.6": "Then those mendicants lifted Upasena’s body onto a cot and carried it outside. ",
  "sn35.69:3.7": "And his body was scattered right there ",
