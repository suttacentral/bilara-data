  "mn60:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Sālā heard: ",
  "mn60:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Sālā, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",

  "mn60:2.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn60:2.6": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "mn60:2.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "mn60:3.1": "Then the brahmins and householders of Sālā went up to the Buddha.
