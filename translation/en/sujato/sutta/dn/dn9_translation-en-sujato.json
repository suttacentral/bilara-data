  "dn9:1.0": "1. On the Wanderer Poṭṭhapāda ",
  "dn9:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn9:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "dn9:1.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for group debates, set among the flaking pale-moon ebony trees. ",
  "dn9:1.4": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
  "dn9:2.1": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "dn9:2.2": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. ",
  "dn9:2.3": "Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?” ",
  "dn9:2.4": "So that’s what he did. ",
  "dn9:3.1": "Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as ",
  "dn9:3.2": "talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. ",
  "dn9:4.1": "Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, ",
  "dn9:4.2": "and hushed his own assembly, ",
  "dn9:4.3": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. ",
  "dn9:4.4": "Here comes the ascetic Gotama. ",
  "dn9:4.5": "The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. ",
  "dn9:4.6": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” ",
  "dn9:4.7": "Then those wanderers fell silent. ",
  "dn9:5.1": "Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda, ",
  "dn9:5.2": "who said to him, ",
  "dn9:5.3": "“Come, Blessed One! ",
  "dn9:5.4": "Welcome, Blessed One! ",
  "dn9:5.5": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. ",
  "dn9:5.6": "Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” ",
  "dn9:5.7": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, ",
  "dn9:5.8": "while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side. ",
  "dn9:5.9": "The Buddha said to him, ",
  "dn9:5.10": "“Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” ",
  "dn9:6.0": "1.1. On the Cessation of Perception ",
  "dn9:6.1": "When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn9:6.2": "“Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now. ",
  "dn9:6.3": "It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. ",
  "dn9:6.4": "Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: ",
  "dn9:6.5": "‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’ ",
  "dn9:6.6": "Some of them said: ",
  "dn9:6.7": "‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason. ",
  "dn9:6.8": "When they arise, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.9": "When they cease, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.10": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.11": "But someone else says: ",
  "dn9:6.12": "‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! ",
  "dn9:6.13": "Perception is a person’s self, ",
  "dn9:6.14": "",
  "dn9:6.15": "When it enters, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.16": "When it departs, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.17": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.18": "But someone else says: ",
  "dn9:6.19": "‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! ",
  "dn9:6.20": "There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might. ",
  "dn9:6.21": "They insert and extract a person’s perception. ",
  "dn9:6.22": "When they insert it, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.23": "When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.24": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.25": "But someone else says: ",
  "dn9:6.26": "‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! ",
  "dn9:6.27": "There are deities of great power and might. ",
  "dn9:6.28": "They insert and extract a person’s perception. ",
  "dn9:6.29": "When they insert it, you become percipient. ",
  "dn9:6.30": "When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ ",
  "dn9:6.31": "That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.32": "That reminded me of the Buddha: ",
  "dn9:6.33": "‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’ ",
  "dn9:6.34": "The Buddha is skilled and well-versed in the cessation of perception. ",
  "dn9:6.35": "How does the cessation of perception happen?” ",
  "dn9:7.0": "1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause ",
  "dn9:7.1": "“Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that ",
  "dn9:7.2": "a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start. ",
  "dn9:7.3": "Why is that? ",
  "dn9:7.4": "Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason. ",
  "dn9:7.5": "With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:7.6": "And what is that training?” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:7.7": "“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … ",
  "dn9:7.8": "That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … ",
  "dn9:8.1": "Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. ",
  "dn9:9-10.1": "Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "dn9:9-10.2": "The sensual perception that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:9-10.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion. ",
  "dn9:9-10.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:9-10.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:11.1": "“Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "dn9:11.2": "The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:11.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion. ",
  "dn9:11.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:11.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:12.1": "“Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "dn9:12.2": "The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:12.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss. ",
  "dn9:12.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:12.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:13.1": "“Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "dn9:13.2": "The subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:13.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling. ",
  "dn9:13.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:13.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:14.1": "“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "dn9:14.2": "The perception of luminous form that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:14.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "dn9:14.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:14.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:15.1": "“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. ",
  "dn9:15.2": "The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:15.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness. ",
  "dn9:15.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:15.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:16.1": "“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. ",
  "dn9:16.2": "The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceases. ",
  "dn9:16.3": "At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingness. ",
  "dn9:16.4": "That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. ",
  "dn9:16.5": "And this is that training,” said the Buddha. ",
  "dn9:17.1": "“Poṭṭhapāda, from the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception. ",
  "dn9:17.2": "Standing on the peak of perception they think, ",
  "dn9:17.3": "‘Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. ",
  "dn9:17.4": "For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. ",
  "dn9:17.5": "Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?’ ",
  "dn9:17.6": "They neither make a choice nor form an intention. ",
  "dn9:17.7": "Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. ",
  "dn9:17.8": "They touch cessation. ",
  "dn9:17.9": "And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness. ",
  "dn9:18.1": "What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? ",
  "dn9:18.2": "Have you ever heard of this before?” ",
  "dn9:18.3": "“No, sir. ",
  "dn9:18.4": "This is how I understand what the Buddha said: ",
  "dn9:18.5": "‘From the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception. ",
  "dn9:18.6": "Standing on the peak of perception they think, ",
  "dn9:18.7": "“Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. ",
  "dn9:18.8": "For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. ",

  "dn9:18.10": "Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. ",
  "dn9:18.11": "They touch cessation. ",
  "dn9:18.12": "And that is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness.’” ",
  "dn9:18.13": "“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” ",
  "dn9:19.1": "“Does the Buddha describe just one peak of perception, or many?” ",
  "dn9:19.2": "“I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” ",
  "dn9:19.3": "“But sir, how do you describe it as one peak and as many?” ",
  "dn9:19.4": "“I describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessation. ",
  "dn9:19.5": "That’s how I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” ",
  "dn9:20.1": "“But sir, does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards? Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards? Or do they both arise at the same time?” ",
  "dn9:20.2": "“Perception arises first and knowledge afterwards. The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge. ",
  "dn9:20.3": "They understand, ",
  "dn9:20.4": "‘My knowledge arose from a specific condition.’ ",
  "dn9:20.5": "That is a way to understand how ",
  "dn9:20.6": "perception arises first and knowledge afterwards; that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge.” ",
  "dn9:21.0": "1.3. Perception and the Self ",
  "dn9:21.1": "“Sir, is perception a person’s self, or are perception and self different things?” ",
  "dn9:21.2": "“But Poṭṭhapāda, do you believe in a self?” ",
  "dn9:21.3": "“I believe in a substantial self, sir, which is physical, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food.” ",
  "dn9:21.4": "“Suppose there were such a substantial self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. ",
  "dn9:21.5": "Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. ",
  "dn9:21.6": "So long as that substantial self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. ",
  "dn9:21.7": "That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” ",
  "dn9:22.1": "“Sir, I believe in a mind-made self which is complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.” ",
  "dn9:22.2": "“Suppose there were such a mind-made self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. ",
  "dn9:22.3": "Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. ",
  "dn9:22.4": "So long as that mind-made self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. ",
  "dn9:22.5": "That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” ",
  "dn9:23.1": "“Sir, I believe in a non-physical self which is made of perception.” ",
  "dn9:23.2": "“Suppose there were such a non-physical self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. ",
  "dn9:23.3": "Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. ",
  "dn9:23.4": "So long as that non-physical self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. ",
  "dn9:23.5": "That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” ",
  "dn9:24.1": "“But, sir, am I able to know whether ",
  "dn9:24.2": "perception is a person’s self, or whether perception and self are different things?” ",
  "dn9:24.3": "“It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.” ",
  "dn9:24.4": "",
  "dn9:25.1": "“Well, if that’s the case, sir, ",
  "dn9:25.2": "",
  "dn9:25.3": "then is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” ",
  "dn9:25.4": "“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.” ",

  "dn9:27.10": "",
  "dn9:28.1": "“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?” ",
  "dn9:28.2": "“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. ",
  "dn9:28.3": "That’s why I haven’t declared them.” ",
  "dn9:29.1": "“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?” ",
  "dn9:29.2": "“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” ",
  "dn9:30.1": "“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?” ",
  "dn9:30.2": "“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. ",

  "dn9:30.5": "Please, sir, go at your convenience.” ",
  "dn9:30.6": "Then the Buddha got up from his seat and left. ",
  "dn9:31.1": "Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers gave Poṭṭhapāda a comprehensive tongue-lashing, ",
  "dn9:31.2": "“No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him: ",
  "dn9:31.3": "‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!’ ",
  "dn9:31.4": "We understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on.” ",
  "dn9:31.5": "",
  "dn9:31.6": "When they said this, Poṭṭhapāda said to them, ",
  "dn9:31.7": "“I too understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on. ",
  "dn9:31.8": "",
  "dn9:31.9": "",
  "dn9:31.10": "Nevertheless, the practice that he describes is true, real, and accurate. It is the regularity of natural principles, the invariance of natural principles. ",
  "dn9:31.11": "So how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spoken?” ",
  "dn9:32.0": "2. On Citta Hatthisāriputta ",
  "dn9:32.1": "Then after two or three days had passed, Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha. Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one side. ",
  "dn9:32.2": "But the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. ",
  "dn9:32.3": "Poṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left. The Buddha said: ",
