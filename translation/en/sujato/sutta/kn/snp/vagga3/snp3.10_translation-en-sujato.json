  "snp3.10:4.3": "The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. ",

  "snp3.10:7.3": "“It’s long, mendicant. ",
  "snp3.10:7.4": "It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” ",

  "snp3.10:7.6": "“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. ",
  "snp3.10:8.1": "“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. ",
  "snp3.10:8.3": "By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. ",

  "snp3.10:8.13": "The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” ",
  "snp3.10:8.14": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "snp3.10:8.15": "Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: ",
