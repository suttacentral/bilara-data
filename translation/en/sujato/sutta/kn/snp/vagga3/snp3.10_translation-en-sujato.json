  "snp3.10:7.6": "“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. ",
  "snp3.10:8.1": "“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. ",
  "snp3.10:8.3": "By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. ",

  "snp3.10:8.13": "The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” ",
  "snp3.10:8.14": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "snp3.10:8.15": "Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: ",
