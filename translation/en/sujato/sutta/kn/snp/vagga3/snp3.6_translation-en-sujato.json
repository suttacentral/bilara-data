  "snp3.6:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "snp3.6:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "snp3.6:1.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with a question by a deity who was a former relative, saying:",
  "snp3.6:1.4": "“Sabhiya, you should practice the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers this question.”",
  "snp3.6:2.1": "Then Sabhiya, after learning that question in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, ",
  "snp3.6:2.2": "Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. ",
  "snp3.6:2.3": "And he asked them that question,",
  "snp3.6:2.4": "but they couldn’t answer it.",
  "snp3.6:2.5": "Instead, displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness,",
  "snp3.6:2.6": "they questioned Sabiya in return.",

  "snp3.6:3.6": "Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?” ",
  "snp3.6:4.1": "Then Sabhiya thought,",
  "snp3.6:4.2": "“This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. ",
  "snp3.6:4.3": "Why don’t I ask him this question?” ",
  "snp3.6:5.1": "Then he thought,",
  "snp3.6:5.2": "“Even those ascetics and brahmins who elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; who are senior, long standing, long gone forth; who lead an order and a community, and teach a community; who are well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people—that is",
  "snp3.6:5.3": "Pūraṇa Kassapa and the rest—",
  "snp3.6:5.4": "could not answer my question, but displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return.",
  "snp3.6:5.5": "How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my question,",
  "snp3.6:5.6": "since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?” ",
  "snp3.6:6.1": "Then he thought,",
  "snp3.6:6.2": "“An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. ",
  "snp3.6:6.3": "Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?” ",
  "snp3.6:7.1": "Then Sabhiya set out for Rājagaha. ",
  "snp3.6:7.2": "Traveling stage by stage, he came to Rājagaha, the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "snp3.6:7.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, ",
  "snp3.6:7.4": "and addressed the Buddha in verse: ",
  "snp3.6:8.1": "“I’ve come full of  doubts and uncertainties,”",
  "snp3.6:8.2": "said Sabhiya,",
  "snp3.6:8.3": "“wishing to ask a question.",

  "snp3.6:10.3": "I’ll solve each and every ",
  "snp3.6:10.4": "question you have.” ",
  "snp3.6:11.1": "Then Sabhiya thought,",
  "snp3.6:11.2": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! ",
  "snp3.6:11.3": "Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.”",

  "snp3.6:12.3": "“How is one sweet, how said to be tamed?",
  "snp3.6:12.4": "How is one declared to be ‘awakened’? ",
  "snp3.6:12.5": "May the Buddha please answer my question.”",
  "snp3.6:13.1": "“When by the path they have walked themselves,”",
  "snp3.6:13.2": "said the Buddha to Sabhiya,",
  "snp3.6:13.3": "“they reach quenching, with doubt overcome;",

  "snp3.6:14.1": "Equanimous towards everything, mindful,",
  "snp3.6:14.2": "they don’t harm anyone in the world.",
  "snp3.6:14.3": "An ascetic who has crossed over, unclouded,",
  "snp3.6:14.4": "not full of themselves, is sweet-natured.",
  "snp3.6:15.1": "Their faculties have been developed",
  "snp3.6:15.2": "internally and externally regarding the whole world.",
  "snp3.6:15.3": "Having pierced through this world and the next,",
  "snp3.6:15.4": "tamed, they bide their time.",
  "snp3.6:16.1": "They have examined the aeons in their entirety,",

  "snp3.6:16.4": "the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained the end of rebirth.”",
  "snp3.6:17.1": "And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question: ",
  "snp3.6:18.1": "“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?”",
  "snp3.6:18.2": "said Sabhiya.",
  "snp3.6:18.3": "“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’?",
  "snp3.6:18.4": "How is one declared to be a ‘giant’? ",
  "snp3.6:18.5": "May the Buddha please answer my question.”",
  "snp3.6:19.1": "“Having banished all bad things,”",
  "snp3.6:19.2": "said the Buddha to Sabhiya,",
  "snp3.6:19.3": "“immaculate, well-composed, steadfast, ",
  "snp3.6:19.4": "consummate, they’ve left transmigration behind;",
  "snp3.6:19.5": "such an unattached one is called ‘brahmin’.",
  "snp3.6:20.1": "A peaceful one who has given up good and evil,",
  "snp3.6:20.2": "stainless, understanding this world and the next,",
  "snp3.6:20.3": "gone beyond rebirth and death;",

  "snp3.6:22.4": "such an one is rightly called ‘dragon’.”",
  "snp3.6:23.1": "And then Sabhiya asked another question: ",
  "snp3.6:24.1": "“Who is a field-winner according to the Buddhas?”",
  "snp3.6:24.2": "said Sabhiya,",
  "snp3.6:24.3": "“Why is one ‘skilled’, and how ‘astute’?",
