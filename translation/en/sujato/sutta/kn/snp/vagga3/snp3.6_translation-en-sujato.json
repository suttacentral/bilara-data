  "snp3.6:1.4": "“Sabhiya, you should practice the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers this question.”",
  "snp3.6:2.1": "Then Sabhiya, after learning that question in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, ",
  "snp3.6:2.2": "Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. ",

  "snp3.6:5.4": "could not answer my question, but displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return.",
  "snp3.6:5.5": "How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my question,",
  "snp3.6:5.6": "since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?” ",
  "snp3.6:6.1": "Then he thought,",
  "snp3.6:6.2": "“An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. ",
  "snp3.6:6.3": "Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?” ",

  "snp3.6:11.1": "Then Sabhiya thought,",
  "snp3.6:11.2": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! ",
  "snp3.6:11.3": "Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.”",

  "snp3.6:16.4": "the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained the end of rebirth.”",
  "snp3.6:17.1": "And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question: ",
  "snp3.6:18.1": "“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?”",
  "snp3.6:18.2": "said Sabhiya.",
  "snp3.6:18.3": "“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’?",
