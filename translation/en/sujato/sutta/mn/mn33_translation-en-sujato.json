  "mn33:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn33:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn33:2.1": "“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. ",
  "mn33:2.2": "What eleven? ",
  "mn33:2.3": "It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. ",
  "mn33:2.4": "A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. ",

  "mn33:6.2": "It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. ",

  "mn33:9.3": "‘Why, sir, does it say this? ",

  "mn33:10.1": "And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction? ",
