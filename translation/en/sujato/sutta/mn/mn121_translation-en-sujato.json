  "mn121:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn121:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. ",
  "mn121:2.1": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "mn121:3.1": "“Sir, this one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville. ",
  "mn121:3.2": "There I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ",
  "mn121:3.3": "‘Ānanda, these days I usually practice the meditation on emptiness.’ ",
  "mn121:3.4": "I trust I properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that from the Buddha?” ",
  "mn121:3.5": "“Indeed, Ānanda, you properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered that. ",
  "mn121:3.6": "Now, as before, I usually practice the meditation on emptiness. ",
  "mn121:4.1": "Consider this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. It’s empty of elephants, cows, horses, and mares; of gold and money; and of gatherings of men and women. ",
  "mn121:4.2": "There is only this that is not emptiness, namely, the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "mn121:4.3": "In the same way, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the village and the perception of people—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness. ",
  "mn121:4.4": "Their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided in that perception of wilderness. ",
  "mn121:4.5": "They understand: ",
  "mn121:4.6": "‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of village or the perception of people. ",
  "mn121:4.7": "There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’ ",
  "mn121:4.8": "They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the village. It is empty of the perception of people. ",
  "mn121:4.9": "There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’ ",
  "mn121:4.10": "And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present. ",
  "mn121:4.11": "That’s how emptiness is born in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure. ",
  "mn121:5.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of people and the perception of wilderness—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth. ",
  "mn121:5.2": "Their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided in that perception of earth. ",
  "mn121:5.3": "As a bull’s hide is rid of folds when fully stretched out by a hundred pegs, ",
  "mn121:5.4": "so too, ignoring the hilly terrain, inaccessible riverlands, stumps and thorns, and rugged mountains, they focus on the oneness dependent on the perception of earth. ",
  "mn121:5.5": "Their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided in that perception of earth. ",
  "mn121:5.6": "They understand: ",
  "mn121:5.7": "‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of people or the perception of wilderness. ",

  "mn121:5.12": "That’s how emptiness is born in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure. ",
  "mn121:6.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of wilderness and the perception of earth—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "mn121:6.2": "Their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided in that perception of the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "mn121:6.3": "They understand: ",
