  "mn144:2.1": "Now at that time the venerables Sāriputta, Mahācunda, and Channa were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "mn144:3.1": "Now at that time Venerable Channa was sick, suffering, gravely ill. ",
  "mn144:3.2": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahācunda and said to him, ",
  "mn144:3.3": "“Come, Reverend Cunda, let’s go to see Venerable Channa and ask about his illness.” ",
  "mn144:3.4": "“Yes, reverend,” replied Mahācunda. ",
  "mn144:4.1": "And then Sāriputta and Mahācunda went to see Channa and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn144:4.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. Then Sāriputta said to Channa, ",
  "mn144:4.3": "“I hope you’re keeping well, Reverend Channa; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” ",
  "mn144:5.1": "“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. ",
  "mn144:5.2": "The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point. ",
  "mn144:5.3": "",
  "mn144:5.4": "The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head. ",
  "mn144:5.5": "",

  "mn144:5.8": "The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. ",
  "mn144:5.9": "I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. ",
  "mn144:5.10": "Reverend Sāriputta, I will slit my wrists. I don’t wish to live.” ",
  "mn144:6.1": "“Please don’t slit your wrists! ",

  "mn144:7.2": "or suitable medicine, ",
  "mn144:7.3": "or a capable carer. ",
  "mn144:7.4": "Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love. ",
  "mn144:7.5": "For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love. ",
  "mn144:7.6": "You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa will slit his wrists blamelessly.’” ",
  "mn144:8.1": "“I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” ",

  "mn144:9.1": "“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’? ",

  "mn144:10.11": "",
  "mn144:10.12": "",
  "mn144:11.1": "When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa: ",
  "mn144:11.2": "“So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can: ",
  "mn144:11.3": "‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation. ",
  "mn144:11.4": "When there’s no agitation there is tranquility. ",
  "mn144:11.5": "When there is tranquility there’s no inclination. ",
  "mn144:11.6": "When there’s no inclination there’s no coming and going. ",
  "mn144:11.7": "When there’s no coming and going there’s no passing away and reappearing. ",
  "mn144:11.8": "When there’s no passing away and reappearing there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two. ",
  "mn144:11.9": "Just this is the end of suffering.’” ",
  "mn144:11.10": "And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left. ",
  "mn144:12.1": "Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists. ",
  "mn144:13.1": "Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn144:13.2": "“Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists. ",
  "mn144:13.3": "Where has he been reborn in his next life?” ",
  "mn144:13.4": "“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?” ",
  "mn144:13.5": "“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana ",
  "mn144:13.6": "where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.” ",
  "mn144:13.7": "“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families. ",
  "mn144:13.8": "But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’. ",
  "mn144:13.9": "When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’. ",
  "mn144:13.10": "But the mendicant Channa did no such thing. ",
  "mn144:13.11": "You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa slit his wrists blamelessly.’” ",
  "mn144:13.12": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn144:13.13": "Satisfied, Venerable Sāriputta was happy with what the Buddha said. "
