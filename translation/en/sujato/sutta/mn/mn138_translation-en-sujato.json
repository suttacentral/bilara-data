  "mn138:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn138:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn138:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn138:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn138:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn138:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn138:2.1": "“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of a recitation passage. ",
  "mn138:2.2": "Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” ",
  "mn138:2.3": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn138:2.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn138:3.1": "“A mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping. ",
  "mn138:3.2": "When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.” ",
  "mn138:4.1": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn138:4.2": "When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. ",
  "mn138:5.1": "Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants considered, ",
  "mn138:5.2": "“The Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail. ",
  "mn138:5.3": "",
  "mn138:5.4": "",
  "mn138:5.5": "Who can explain in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha?” ",
  "mn138:5.6": "Then those mendicants thought, ",
  "mn138:5.7": "“This Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. ",
  "mn138:5.8": "He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha. ",
  "mn138:5.9": "Let’s go to him, and ask him about this matter.” ",
  "mn138:6.1": "Then those mendicants went to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn138:6.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. They told him what had happened, and said, ",

  "mn138:6.15": "“May Venerable Mahākaccāna please explain this.” ",
  "mn138:7.1": "“Reverends, suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. And while wandering in search of heartwood he’d come across a large tree standing with heartwood. But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. ",
  "mn138:7.2": "Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter. ",
  "mn138:7.3": "For he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One. ",
  "mn138:7.4": "That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. ",
  "mn138:7.5": "You should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” ",
  "mn138:8.1": "“Certainly he is the Buddha, who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the truth, he is supreme. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One. ",
  "mn138:8.2": "That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter. ",
  "mn138:8.3": "We should have remembered it in line with the Buddha’s answer. ",
  "mn138:8.4": "Still, Venerable Mahākaccāna is praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. ",
  "mn138:8.5": "He is capable of explaining in detail the meaning of this brief passage for recitation given by the Buddha. ",

  "mn138:9.2": "“Yes, reverend,” they replied. ",
  "mn138:9.3": "Venerable Mahākaccāna said this: ",
  "mn138:9.4": "“Reverends, the Buddha gave this brief passage for recitation, then entered his dwelling without explaining the meaning in detail: ",
  "mn138:9.5": "‘A mendicant should examine in any such a way that their consciousness is neither scattered and diffused externally nor stuck internally, and they are not anxious because of grasping. When this is the case and they are no longer anxious, there is for them no coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future.’ ",

  "mn138:14.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "mn138:14.2": "Their consciousness follows after that equanimity, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that equanimous bliss. So their mind is said to be stuck internally. ",
  "mn138:15.1": "Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "mn138:15.2": "Their consciousness follows after that neutral feeling, tied, attached, and fettered to gratification in that neutral feeling. So their mind is said to be stuck internally. ",
