  "mn25:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn25:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn25:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn25:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn25:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn25:2.1": "“Mendicants, a sower does not sow seed for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.2": "‘May the deer, enjoying this seed, be healthy and in good condition. May they live long and prosper!’ ",
  "mn25:2.3": "A sower sows seed for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.4": "‘When these deer encroach on where I sow the seed, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this seed.’ ",
  "mn25:3.1": "And indeed, the first herd of deer encroached on where the sower sowed the seed and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the sower was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that seed. ",
  "mn25:3.2": "And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.1": "So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan, ",
  "mn25:4.2": "‘The first herd of deer became indulgent … ",
  "mn25:4.3": "",
  "mn25:4.4": "and failed to get free of the sower’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.5": "Why don’t we avoid eating the seed altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’ ",
  "mn25:4.6": "And that’s just what they did. ",
  "mn25:4.7": "But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin, ",
  "mn25:4.8": "and they lost their strength and energy. ",
  "mn25:4.9": "So they returned to where the sower had sown the seed. ",

  "mn25:4.12": "And that’s how the second herd of deer failed to get free from the sower’s power. ",

  "mn25:5.15": "Why don’t we set up our lair close by where the sower has sown the seed? ",
  "mn25:5.16": "Then we can encroach and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then the sower won’t be able to do what he wants with us on account of that seed.’ ",
  "mn25:5.17": "And that’s just what they did. ",

  "mn25:5.20": "‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of strange spirits with magical abilities! ",
  "mn25:5.21": "For they eat the seed we’ve sown without us knowing how they come and go. ",
  "mn25:5.22": "Why don’t we surround the seed on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see the lair where they go to hide out.’ ",
