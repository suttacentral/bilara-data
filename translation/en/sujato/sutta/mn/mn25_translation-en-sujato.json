  "mn25:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn25:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn25:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn25:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn25:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn25:2.1": "“Mendicants, a trapper doesn’t cast bait for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.2": "‘May the deer, enjoying this bait, be healthy and in good condition. May they live long and prosper!’ ",
  "mn25:2.3": "A trapper casts bait for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.4": "‘When these deer intrude on where I cast the bait, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then they’ll be vulnerable on account of this bait.’ ",
  "mn25:3.1": "And indeed, the first herd of deer intruded on where the trapper cast the bait and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then they were vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait. ",
  "mn25:3.2": "And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the trapper’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.1": "So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan, ",
  "mn25:4.2": "‘The first herd of deer became indulgent … ",
  "mn25:4.3": " ",
  "mn25:4.4": "and failed to get free of the trapper’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.5": "Why don’t we avoid eating the bait altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’ ",
  "mn25:4.6": "And that’s just what they did. ",
  "mn25:4.7": "But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin, ",
  "mn25:4.8": "and they lost their strength and energy. ",
  "mn25:4.9": "So they went back to that same place where the trapper had cast bait. ",
  "mn25:4.10": "Intruding on that place, they recklessly enjoyed eating it … ",

  "mn25:4.12": "And that’s how the second herd failed to get free from the trapper’s power. ",

  "mn25:5.16": "Then we can intrude on it and enjoy eating without being reckless. We won’t become indulgent, then we won’t become negligent, and then we won’t be vulnerable to the trapper on account of that bait.’ ",

  "mn25:5.18": " ",
  "mn25:5.19": "So the trapper and his companions thought, ",
  "mn25:5.20": "‘Wow, this third herd of deer is so sneaky and devious, they must be some kind of unnatural spirits with psychic power! ",
  "mn25:5.21": "For they eat the bait we’ve cast without us knowing how they come and go. ",
  "mn25:5.22": "Why don’t we surround the bait on all sides by staking out high nets? Hopefully we might get to see their lair, where they go to hide out.’ ",
  "mn25:5.23": "And that’s just what they did. ",
