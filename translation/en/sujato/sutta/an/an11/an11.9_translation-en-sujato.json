  "an11.9:1.2": "Then Venerable Sandha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: ",
  "an11.9:2.1": "“Sandha, meditate like a thoroughbred, ",
  "an11.9:2.2": "not like a wild colt. ",
  "an11.9:2.3": "And how does a wild colt meditate? ",
  "an11.9:2.4": "A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",
  "an11.9:2.5": "Why is that? ",
  "an11.9:2.6": "Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ",

  "an11.9:2.8": "Tied up by the feeding trough they just meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",
  "an11.9:2.9": "In the same way, take a certain wild person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. ",

  "an11.9:2.17": "That’s how a wild colt meditates. ",
  "an11.9:3.1": "And how does a thoroughbred meditate? ",
  "an11.9:3.2": "A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ ",
  "an11.9:3.3": "Why is that? ",

  "an11.9:3.14": "Yet they do meditate. ",
  "an11.9:3.15": "When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship them from afar: ",

The perception of the dimension of infinite space has vanished in relation to the dimension of infinite space. The perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither perception nor non-perception has vanished in relation to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The perception of this world has vanished in relation to this world. The perception of the other world has vanished in relation to the other world.
