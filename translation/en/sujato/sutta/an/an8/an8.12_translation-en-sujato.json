  "an8.12:2.2": "He thought, ",
  "an8.12:2.3": "“That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. ",
  "an8.12:2.4": "Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” ",
  "an8.12:2.5": "Then General Sīha went to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan and said to him, ",
  "an8.12:2.6": "“Sir, I’d like to go to see the ascetic Gotama.” ",
  "an8.12:3.1": "“But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of inaction? ",
  "an8.12:3.2": "For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.” ",
  "an8.12:3.3": "Then Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down. ",
  "an8.12:4.1": "For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. ",
  "an8.12:4.2": "And for a second time Sīha thought: ",

  "an8.12:7.2": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by foot. ",
  "an8.12:7.3": "Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "an8.12:8.1": "“Sir, I have heard this: ",
  "an8.12:8.2": "‘The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.’ ",
  "an8.12:8.3": "I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? ",
  "an8.12:8.4": "For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.” ",
  "an8.12:9.1": "“There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say that ",

  "an8.12:27.4": "Sir, I have heard this: ",
  "an8.12:27.5": "‘The ascetic Gotama says, ",
  "an8.12:27.6": "“Gifts should only be given to me, and to my disciples. ",
  "an8.12:27.7": "Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. ",

  "an8.12:27.12": "From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "an8.12:28.1": "Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with ",
  "an8.12:28.2": "a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. ",
  "an8.12:28.3": "And when the Buddha knew that Sīha’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: ",
  "an8.12:28.4": "suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. ",
  "an8.12:28.5": "Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, ",
  "an8.12:28.6": "in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha: ",
  "an8.12:28.7": "“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” ",
  "an8.12:29.1": "Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, ",
  "an8.12:29.2": "“Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” ",
  "an8.12:29.3": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "an8.12:29.4": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
  "an8.12:30.1": "Then Sīha addressed a certain man, ",
  "an8.12:30.2": "“Mister, please find out if there is any meat ready for sale.” ",
  "an8.12:30.3": "And when the night had passed General Sīha had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, ",
  "an8.12:30.4": "“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” ",
  "an8.12:31.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "an8.12:31.2": "Now at that time many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and from square to square, calling out with raised arms: ",
  "an8.12:31.3": "“Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. ",
  "an8.12:31.4": "The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.” ",
  "an8.12:32.1": "Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his ear, ",
  "an8.12:32.2": "“Please sir, you should know this. ",
  "an8.12:32.3": "Many Jain ascetics in Vesālī are going from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms: ",
  "an8.12:32.4": "‘Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. ",
  "an8.12:32.5": "The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.’” ",
  "an8.12:32.6": "“Enough, sir. For a long time those venerables have wanted to discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha. ",
  "an8.12:32.7": "They’ll never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their false, hollow, lying, untruthful claims. ",
  "an8.12:32.8": "We would never deliberately take the life of a living creature, not even for life’s sake.” ",
  "an8.12:33.1": "Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. ",
  "an8.12:33.2": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. ",
  "an8.12:33.3": "Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. "
