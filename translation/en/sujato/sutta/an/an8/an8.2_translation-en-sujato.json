  "an8.2:1.1": "“Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired. ",
  "an8.2:1.2": "What eight? ",
  "an8.2:1.3": "It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. ",
  "an8.2:1.4": "This is the first cause. ",
  "an8.2:2.1": "When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions: ",
  "an8.2:2.2": "‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ ",

  "an8.2:5.1": "They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. ",
  "an8.2:5.2": "This is the fifth cause. ",
  "an8.2:6.1": "They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. ",

  "an8.2:7.1": "When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or low talk. ",
  "an8.2:7.2": "Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence. ",
  "an8.2:7.3": "This is the seventh cause. ",
  "an8.2:8.1": "They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ",
  "an8.2:8.2": "‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. ",
  "an8.2:8.3": "Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. ",
  "an8.2:8.4": "Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. ",
  "an8.2:8.5": "Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. ",
