  "an4.159:6.4": "Take a mendicant who hears this: ",
  "an4.159:6.5": "‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ ",

  "an4.159:9.4": "“Indeed, sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. ",
  "an4.159:9.5": "But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. ",
  "an4.159:9.6": "For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” "
