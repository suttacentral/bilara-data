  "an10.93:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "an10.93:1.2": "Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. ",
  "an10.93:1.3": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "an10.93:1.4": "“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, ",
  "an10.93:1.5": "as he’s in retreat. ",
  "an10.93:1.6": "And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, ",
  "an10.93:1.7": "as they’re in retreat. ",
  "an10.93:1.8": "Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” ",
  "an10.93:2.1": "Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths. ",
  "an10.93:2.2": "Now at that time, the wanderers who follow other paths had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics. ",
  "an10.93:2.3": "They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance, ",
  "an10.93:2.4": "and stopped each other, saying, ",
  "an10.93:2.5": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. ",
  "an10.93:2.6": "The householder Anāthapiṇḍika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. ",
  "an10.93:2.7": "He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. ",
  "an10.93:2.8": "Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. ",
  "an10.93:2.9": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” ",
  "an10.93:3.1": "Then those wanderers who follow other paths fell silent. ",
  "an10.93:3.2": "Then Anāthapiṇḍika went up to them, and exchanged greetings with those wanderers. ",
  "an10.93:3.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him, ",
  "an10.93:3.4": "“Tell us, householder, what is the view of the ascetic Gotama?” ",
  "an10.93:3.5": "“Sirs, I don’t know all his views.” ",
  "an10.93:4.1": "“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama, ",
  "an10.93:4.2": "tell us, what are the views of the mendicants?” ",
  "an10.93:4.3": "“Sirs, I don’t know all the mendicants’ views.” ",
  "an10.93:5.1": "“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the mendicants, ",
  "an10.93:5.2": "tell us, householder, what is your view?” ",
  "an10.93:5.3": "“Sirs, it’s not hard for me to explain what my views are. ",
  "an10.93:5.4": "But please, let the venerables explain their own convictions first. Afterwards it won’t be hard for me to explain my views.” ",
  "an10.93:6.1": "When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, ",
  "an10.93:6.2": "“The world is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. ",
  "an10.93:6.3": "That’s my view, householder.” ",
  "an10.93:7.1": "Another wanderer said, ",
  "an10.93:7.2": "“The world is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. ",
  "an10.93:7.3": "That’s my view, householder.” ",
  "an10.93:8.1": "Another wanderer said, ",
  "an10.93:8.2": "“The world is finite …” … ",

  "an10.93:8.10": "That’s my view, householder.” ",
  "an10.93:9.1": "When this was said, Anāthapiṇḍika said this, ",
  "an10.93:9.2": "“Sirs, regarding the venerable who said this: ",
  "an10.93:9.3": "‘The world is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. ",
  "an10.93:9.4": "That’s my view, householder.’ ",
  "an10.93:9.5": "This view of his has either arisen from his own improper attention, or is conditioned by what someone else says. ",
  "an10.93:9.6": "But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated. ",
  "an10.93:9.7": "Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. ",
  "an10.93:9.8": "And what’s impermanent is suffering. ",
  "an10.93:9.9": "What he clings to and holds to is just suffering. ",
  "an10.93:10.1": "Regarding the venerable who said this: ",
  "an10.93:10.2": "‘The world is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. ",

  "an10.93:12.1": "When he said this the wanderers said to him, ",
  "an10.93:12.2": "“Householder, we’ve each explained our own convictions. ",
  "an10.93:12.3": "Tell us, householder, what is your view?” ",
  "an10.93:12.4": "“Sirs, anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. ",
  "an10.93:12.5": "And what’s impermanent is suffering. ",
  "an10.93:12.6": "And what’s suffering is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self. ",

  "an10.93:13.1": "“Householder, anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. ",

  "an10.93:14.2": "And what’s impermanent is suffering. ",
  "an10.93:14.3": "And I’ve truly seen clearly with right wisdom that what’s suffering is not mine, I am not this, it’s not my self. ",
  "an10.93:14.4": "And I truly understand the escape beyond that.” ",
  "an10.93:15.1": "When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",
  "an10.93:15.2": "Seeing this, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. ",
  "an10.93:15.3": "“Good, good, householder! ",
  "an10.93:15.4": "That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time.” ",
  "an10.93:16.1": "Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the householder Anāthapiṇḍika with a Dhamma talk, ",
  "an10.93:16.2": "after which Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. ",
  "an10.93:17.1": "Then, not long after Anāthapiṇḍika had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "an10.93:17.2": "“Mendicants, even a mendicant who has ordained for a hundred years in this teaching and training would legitimately and completely refute those wanderers who follow other paths just as the householder Anāthapiṇḍika did.” "
