  "an3.35:2.1": "“The winter nights are cold, sir, and it’s the week of mid-winter, when the snow falls. Rough is the ground trampled under the cows’ hooves, and thin is the mat of leaves. The leaves are sparse on the trees, the ocher robes are cold, and cold blows the north wind. ",

  "an3.35:3.9": "Of those who sleep at ease in the world, he would be one.” ",
  "an3.35:4.1": "“What do you think, prince? ",
  "an3.35:4.2": "Is it not possible that a fever born of greed—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?” ",

  "an3.35:5.1": "“The greed that burns that householder or householder’s son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. ",

  "an3.35:9.1": "Since they’ve cut off all clinging, ",
  "an3.35:9.2": "and removed the stress from the heart, ",
