  "an3.37:1.2": "‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in their families, observing the sabbath, staying awake, and making merit.’ ",

  "an3.37:1.4": "‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’ ",
  "an3.37:1.5": "And on the fifteenth day sabbath, the Four Great Kings themselves wander about the world, thinking: ",
  "an3.37:1.6": "‘Hopefully most humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit.’ ",
  "an3.37:2.1": "If only a few humans are paying due respect to their parents … and making merit, ",
