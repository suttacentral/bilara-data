Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. ",
  "an9.4:13.3": "There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment.
