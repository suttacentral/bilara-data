  "sn20.7:1.1": "At Sāvatthī. ",
  "sn20.7:1.2": "“Once upon a time, mendicants, the Dasārahas had a clay drum called the Commander. ",
  "sn20.7:1.3": "Each time the Commander split they repaired it by inserting another peg. ",
  "sn20.7:1.4": "But there came a time when the clay drum Commander’s original wooden rim disappeared ",
  "sn20.7:1.5": "and only a mass of pegs remained. ",
  "sn20.7:1.6": "In the same way, in a future time there will be mendicants who won’t want to listen when discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—are being recited. They won’t actively listen or try to understand, nor will they think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. ",
  "sn20.7:2.1": "But when discourses composed by poets—poetry, with fancy words and phrases, composed by outsiders or spoken by disciples—are being recited they will want to listen. They’ll actively listen and try to understand, and they’ll think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. ",
  "sn20.7:2.2": "And that is how the discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—will disappear. ",
  "sn20.7:2.3": "So you should train like this: ",

  "sn20.7:2.5": "That’s how you should train.” "
