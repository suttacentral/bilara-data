  "an3.72:1.1": "At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. ",
  "an3.72:1.2": "Then a householder who was a disciple of the Ājīvaka ascetics went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: ",
  "an3.72:2.1": "“Sir, whose teaching is well explained? ",
  "an3.72:2.2": "Who in the world is practicing well? ",
  "an3.72:2.3": "Who in the world has done well?” ",
  "an3.72:2.4": "“Well then, householder, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. ",
  "an3.72:2.5": "What do you think, householder? ",
  "an3.72:2.6": "Is the teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion well explained or not? ",
  "an3.72:2.7": "Or how do you see this?” ",
  "an3.72:2.8": "“The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained. ",

  "an3.72:3.4": "“Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well. ",
  "an3.72:3.5": "That’s how I see it.” ",
  "an3.72:4.1": "“What do you think, householder? ",
  "an3.72:4.2": "Have those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion—so they’re cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future—done well in the world, or not? ",

  "an3.72:4.5": "That’s how I see it.” ",
  "an3.72:5.1": "“So, householder, you’ve declared: ",
  "an3.72:5.2": "‘The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.’ ",
  "an3.72:5.3": "And you’ve declared: ",
  "an3.72:5.4": "‘Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well.’ ",
  "an3.72:5.5": "And you’ve declared: ",
  "an3.72:5.6": "‘Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world.’” ",
  "an3.72:6.1": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! ",
  "an3.72:6.2": "There’s no acclaiming your own teaching or disrespecting someone else’s, ",
  "an3.72:6.3": "just teaching what’s relevant in that context. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved. ",
  "an3.72:6.4": "You, sir, teach Dhamma for giving up greed, hate, and delusion. ",
  "an3.72:6.5": "Your teaching is well explained. ",
  "an3.72:6.6": "You, sir, practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion. ",
  "an3.72:6.7": "You in the world are practicing well. ",
  "an3.72:6.8": "You’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion. ",
  "an3.72:6.9": "You in the world have done well. ",
  "an3.72:7.1": "Excellent, sir! Excellent! ",
  "an3.72:7.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "an3.72:7.3": "I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "an3.72:7.4": "From this day forth, may Venerable Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” "
