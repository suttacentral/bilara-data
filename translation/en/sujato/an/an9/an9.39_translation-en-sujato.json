  "an9.39:4.8": "‘Now we’re in a secure location and the gods can’t do anything to us.’ ",

  "an9.39:5.1": "In the same way, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "an9.39:5.2": "At such a time the mendicant thinks, ",
  "an9.39:5.3": "‘Now I’m in a secure location and Māra can’t do anything to me.’ ",

  "an9.39:6.4": "At such a time the mendicant thinks, ",

  "an9.39:7.1": "A mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "an9.39:7.2": "At such a time they are called a mendicant who has blinded Māra, put out his eyes without a trace, and gone where the Wicked One cannot see. ",
  "an9.39:8.1": "A mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … ",
