  "an9.41:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa. ",
  "an9.41:1.2": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. ",
  "an9.41:1.3": "Then, after the meal, on his return from alms-round, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "an9.41:1.4": "“Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s meditation.” ",
  "an9.41:1.5": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "an9.41:1.6": "Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. ",
  "an9.41:2.1": "The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "an9.41:3.1": "“Sir, Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. ",
  "an9.41:3.2": "But renunciation seems like an abyss. ",
  "an9.41:3.3": "I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are eager for renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. ",
  "an9.41:3.4": "Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.” ",
  "an9.41:4.1": "“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. ",
  "an9.41:4.2": "Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this. ",
  "an9.41:4.3": "As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” ",
  "an9.41:5.1": "“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa. ",
  "an9.41:5.2": "Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened. ",

  "an9.41:7.1": "“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! ",
  "an9.41:7.2": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ",
  "an9.41:7.3": "‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ ",
  "an9.41:7.4": "But my mind wasn’t eager for renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. ",
  "an9.41:7.5": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:7.6": "‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ ",
  "an9.41:7.7": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:7.8": "‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. ",
  "an9.41:7.9": "That’s why my mind isn’t eager for renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ ",
  "an9.41:7.10": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:7.11": "‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. ",
  "an9.41:7.12": "It’s possible that my mind would be eager for renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ ",
  "an9.41:7.13": "And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. ",
  "an9.41:7.14": "Then my mind was eager for renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful. ",
  "an9.41:7.15": "And so, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "an9.41:7.16": "While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, and that was an affliction for me. ",
  "an9.41:7.17": "Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. ",
  "an9.41:7.18": "In the same way, when perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me, that was an affliction for me. ",
  "an9.41:8.1": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:8.2": "‘Why don’t I, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … enter and remain in the second absorption?’ ",
  "an9.41:8.3": "But my mind wasn’t eager to stop placing the mind; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. ",
  "an9.41:8.4": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:8.5": "‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager to stop placing the mind, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ ",

  "an9.41:8.8": "That’s why my mind isn’t eager to stop placing the mind, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ ",
  "an9.41:8.9": "Then I thought, ",

It’s possible that my mind would be eager to stop placing the mind; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ ",

  "an9.41:9.1": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:9.2": "‘Why don’t I, with the fading away of rapture, enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss”?’ ",
  "an9.41:9.3": "But my mind wasn’t eager for freedom from rapture; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. ",
  "an9.41:9.4": "Then I thought, ",
  "an9.41:9.5": "‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t eager for freedom from rapture, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ ",
