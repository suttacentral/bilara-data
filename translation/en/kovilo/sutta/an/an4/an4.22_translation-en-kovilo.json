  "an4.22:1.1": "“At one time, just after having attained full enlightenment, I was living here in Uruvela on the banks of the Nerañjara River at the goatheard's banyon tree.",
  "an4.22:1.2": "Then a large number of august brahmans who were elderly, senior, experienced, and advanced in age approached me and greeted me sociably.",
  "an4.22:1.3": "Having exchanged sociable greetings and friendly words, they sat down to one side and said this to me:",
  "an4.22:1.4": "‘Master Gotama, we have heard the following:",
  "an4.22:1.5": "“The ascetic Gotama doesn't honor august brahmans who are elderly, senior, experienced, and advanced in age. Nor does he raise up and offer them a seat.”",
  "an4.22:1.6": "Master Gotama, this is true!",
  "an4.22:1.7": "For indeed you do not honor august brahmans who are elderly, senior, experienced, and advanced in age. Nor do you raise up and offer them a seat.",

  "an4.22:2.5": "then that person is considered a ‘childish elder.’ ",
  "an4.22:3.1": "On the other hand, if one is a youthful adolescent—a boy with black hair endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life—",
  "an4.22:3.2": "but they speak at appropriate times, truthfully, purposefully, and they speak what is Dhamma, and what is discipline; they speak timely words which are worth treasuring, which are reasonable, measured, and connected with what is beneficial, ",
  "an4.22:3.3": "then that person is considered a ‘discerning elder.’ ",
  "an4.22:4.1": "There are these four qualities that make one an elder.",
  "an4.22:4.2": "What four?",
  "an4.22:4.3": "“Here a monk is virtuous. They dwell restrained by the restraint of the monk's rules and are skilled in their behavior and choose their environment wisely. They see danger in the slightest faults and, having taken them on, they train themselves according to the training precepts."
