  "mil3.6.9:1.2": "“Venerable Nāgasena, as to which you said ‘cyclic existence’. What is this cyclic existence?” ",
  "mil3.6.9:1.3": "“Your majesty, that which is born here dies here, and having died here, it arises elsewhere. Then, having been born there it dies there, and having died there, it arises elsewhere. Thus, your majesty, this is cyclic existence.” ",
  "mil3.6.9:1.4": "“Please give me an analogy.” ",
  "mil3.6.9:1.5": "“Just as, your majesty, some person may eat a ripe mango and plant the seed. Then, when it has grown up as a mature mango tree, it would give fruit. And then that man might eat a ripe mango from it and plant the seed and, when it has grown up as a mature mango tree, it too would give fruit. And thus, no end to these mango trees can be discerned.” ",
  "mil3.6.9:1.6": "“In the same way, your majesty, that which is born here dies here, and having died here, it arises elsewhere. Then, having been born there it dies there, and having died there, it arises elsewhere. Thus, your majesty, this is cyclic existence.” ",
