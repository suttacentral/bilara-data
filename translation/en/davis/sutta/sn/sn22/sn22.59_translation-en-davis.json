  "sn22.59:1.4": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "sn22.59:1.5": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "sn22.59:2.1": "“Mendicants, form is not-self. ",
  "sn22.59:2.2": "For if form were self, it wouldn’t lead to affliction. And you could compel form: ",
  "sn22.59:2.3": "‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that!’ ",
  "sn22.59:2.4": "But because form is not-self, it leads to affliction. And you can’t compel form: ",

  "sn22.59:5.1": "Consciousness is not-self. ",
  "sn22.59:5.2": "For if consciousness were self, it wouldn’t lead to affliction. And you could compel consciousness: ",
  "sn22.59:5.3": "‘May my consciousness be like this! May it not be like that!’ ",
  "sn22.59:5.4": "But because consciousness is not-self, it leads to affliction. And you can’t compel consciousness: ",

  "sn22.59:6.1": "What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "sn22.59:6.2": "Is form permanent or impermanent?” ",
  "sn22.59:6.3": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn22.59:6.4": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn22.59:6.5": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn22.59:6.6": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",

  "sn22.59:6.18": "“No, sir.” ",
  "sn22.59:7.1": "“So you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: *all* form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ ",

  "sn22.59:11.1": "Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ",
  "sn22.59:11.2": "Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "sn22.59:11.3": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” ",
  "sn22.59:12.1": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "sn22.59:12.2": "Satisfied, the group of five mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. ",
  "sn22.59:12.3": "And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the group of five mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping. "
