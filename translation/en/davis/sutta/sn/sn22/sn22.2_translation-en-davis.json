  "sn22.2:4.4": "‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom.

You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. ",
