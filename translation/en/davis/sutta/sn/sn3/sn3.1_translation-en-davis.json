  "sn3.1:1.7": "For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.” ",
  "sn3.1:2.1": "“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, ",
