  "sn6.2:1.3": "Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ",
  "sn6.2:1.4": "“It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?” ",
  "sn6.2:2.1": "Then it occurred to him: ",
  "sn6.2:2.2": "“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. ",
  "sn6.2:2.3": "But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. ",

  "sn6.2:6.2": "But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on. ",
  "sn6.2:6.3": "Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” ",
  "sn6.2:7.1": "Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "sn6.2:7.2": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ",
  "sn6.2:7.3": "“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! ",

  "sn6.2:9.3": "and they also will live. ",
  "sn6.2:9.4": "This is the nature of the Buddhas. ",
  "sn6.2:10.1": "Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, ",
  "sn6.2:10.2": "and wants to become the very best they can be, ",
  "sn6.2:10.3": "should respect the true teaching, ",
  "sn6.2:10.4": "remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.”"
