  "dhp60:3": "long transmigrate the fools ",
  "dhp60:4": "who don’t understand the true teaching. ",
  "dhp61:1": "If while wandering you find no partner ",
  "dhp61:2": "equal or better than yourself, ",
  "dhp61:3": "then firmly resolve to wander alone—",
  "dhp61:4": "there’s no fellowship with fools. ",
  "dhp62:1": "“Sons are mine, wealth is mine”—",
  "dhp62:2": "thus the fool frets. ",
  "dhp62:3": "But you can’t even call your self your own, ",

  "dhp63:1": "The fool who thinks they’re a fool ",
  "dhp63:2": "is wise at least to that extent. ",

  "dhp64:1": "Though a fool attends to the wise ",
  "dhp64:2": "even for the rest of their life, ",
  "dhp64:3": "they still don’t experience the teaching, ",

  "dhp65:1": "If a clever person attends to the wise ",
  "dhp65:2": "even just for an hour or so, ",
  "dhp65:3": "they swiftly experience the teaching, ",
  "dhp65:4": "like a tongue the taste of the soup. ",
  "dhp66:1": "Witless fools behave ",
  "dhp66:2": "like their own worst enemies, ",
  "dhp66:3": "doing wicked deeds ",

  "dhp67:1": "It’s not good to do a deed ",
  "dhp67:2": "that plagues you later on, ",

  "dhp69:1": "The fool imagines that evil is sweet, ",
  "dhp69:2": "so long as it has not yet ripened. ",
  "dhp69:3": "But as soon as that evil ripens, ",

  "dhp70:4": "of one who has fathomed the teaching. ",
  "dhp71:1": "For a wicked deed that has been done ",
  "dhp71:2": "does not spoil quickly like milk. ",
