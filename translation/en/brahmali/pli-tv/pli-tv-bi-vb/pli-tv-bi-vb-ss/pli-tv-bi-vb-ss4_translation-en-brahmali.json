  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.2": "At that time the nun Caṇḍakāḷī started quarrels and disputes, and created legal issues in the midst of the Sangha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.3": "But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun Thullanandā protested against it. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.4": "Soon afterwards Thullanandā went to a village on some business. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.5": "The Sangha of nuns ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.6": "took the opportunity to eject Caṇḍakāḷī for not seeing an offense. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.7": "When Thullanandā had finished her business in that village, she returned to Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.8": "Upon her return, Caṇḍakāḷī neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, or water for washing, and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe and to ask whether she wanted anything to drink. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.9": "Thullanandā asked her ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.10": "why she was acting like this. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.11": "She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when one is without a protector.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.12": "“But how is it, Venerable, that you’re without a protector?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.13": "“Because when these nuns knew ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.14": "that I was without a protector and that no-one would speak up for me because of my bad reputation, they ejected me for not seeing an offense.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.16": "“They are incompetent fools. They don’t know about legal procedures, the flaws in such procedures, or what constitutes their failure or successful accomplishment. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.17": "But we know all these things. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.18": "We can get legal procedures done that haven’t been done, or we can get procedures that have been done invalidated.” And having quickly assembled a sangha of nuns, she reinstated the nun Caṇḍakāḷī. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.19": "The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.20": "“How could Venerable Thullanandā reinstate a nun who has been ejected by a complete Sangha in accordance with the Teaching, the training, and the Teacher’s instruction, without getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group?” … ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.21": "“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.22": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.23": "The Buddha rebuked her: “… ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.24": "How can the nun Thullanandā reinstate a nun who has been ejected by a complete Sangha in accordance with the Teaching, the training, and the Teacher’s instruction, without getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the group? ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:1.25": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
