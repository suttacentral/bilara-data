  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.2": "At that time, after spending the rainy-season residence in a village monastery, a number of nuns were traveling to Sāvatthī. They were perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.3": "Some lay followers who saw them thought,",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.4": "“These nuns are perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes; they must’ve been robbed,” and they gave out-of-season robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.5": "Because they had done the robe-making ceremony, the nun Thullanandā",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.6": "determined it as in-season robe-cloth, and then shared it out.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.7": "The lay disciples asked those nuns whether",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.9": "and they replied that they hadn’t",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.10": "and told them what had happened.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.12": "Those lay disciples then complained and criticized her,",
