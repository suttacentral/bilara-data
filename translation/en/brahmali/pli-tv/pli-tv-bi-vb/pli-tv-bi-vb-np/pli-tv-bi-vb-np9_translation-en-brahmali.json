  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np9:1.2": "At that time the nuns staying at the precincts belonging to certain association were weak because of a lack of rice-porridge.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np9:1.3": "Then, after collecting voluntary contributions with the aim of supplying rice-porridge for the nuns, that association stored the requisites in the house of a shopkeeper. They then went to the nuns and said,",
