  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.2": "There the Buddha addressed the monks, “Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for three months.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.3": "No one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.4": "“Yes, Sir,” they replied, and no one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.5": "Soon afterwards the Sangha at Sāvatthī made the following agreement:",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.8": "Anyone who approaches him should be made to confess an offense entailing confession.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.9": "Just then Venerable Upasena Vaṅgantaputta and his followers approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.10": "Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said this to Upasena,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.11": "“I hope you’re keeping well, Upasena, I hope you’re comfortable;",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.15": "One of Upasena’s students was seated not far from the Buddha, and the Buddha said to him,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.16": "“Do you like rag-robes, monk?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.17": "“I don’t like rag-robes, Sir.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.18": "“Why then do you wear them?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.19": "“My preceptor wears them, and so I do it too.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.20": "And the Buddha said to Upasena, “Upasena, your followers are inspiring.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.22": "“When anyone asks me for the full ordination, Sir, I tell them this:",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.24": "If you do the same, I’ll give you the full ordination.’",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.25": "If they agree, I ordain them; otherwise I don’t.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.26": "And I do the same when anyone asks me for formal support.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.1.30": "It’s in this way that I train my followers.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.1": "“Good, Upasena, you train your followers well.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.2": "But do you know the agreement made by the Sangha at Sāvatthī?”",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.15": "Just then many monks were standing outside the gateway, thinking, “We’ll make Venerable Upasena confess an offense entailing confession.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.16": "Upasena and his followers got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.17": "And those monks said to Upasena, “Upasena, do you know the agreement of the Sangha at Sāvatthī?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.18": "“The Buddha asked me the same question, and I replied that I didn’t.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.19": "He then told me what it was, and I said,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.23": "‘Sir, the Sangha at Sāvatthī will become known for this agreement.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.2.27": "Those monks thought, “It’s true what Venerable Upasena says.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.1": "The monks heard that the Buddha had allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear only rag-robes to go and see him whenever they please.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.2": "Longing to see the Buddha, they discarded their blankets and undertook the practice of staying in the wilderness, of eating only almsfood, and of wearing only rag-robes.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.3": "Soon afterwards the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, and he saw discarded blankets here and there.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.4": "He asked the monks, “Whose are these discarded blankets?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.5": "The monks told the Buddha.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.6": "Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.7": "“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons:",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np15:1.3.8": "for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions in the present life, for avoiding corruptions in future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the continuation of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.",
