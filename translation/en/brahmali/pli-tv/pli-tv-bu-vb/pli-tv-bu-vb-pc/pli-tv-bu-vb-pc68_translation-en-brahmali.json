  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.2": "At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had taken the following bad and erroneous view:",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.3": "“As I understand the Teaching of the Master, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.4": "A number of monks heard",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.5": "that Ariṭṭha had taken that view.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.8": "They went to him and asked,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.9": "“Is it true, Ariṭṭha,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.10": "that you have taken such a view?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.11": "“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Master’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.12": "“No, Ariṭṭha, don’t misrepresent the Master, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Master would never say such a thing.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.13": "The Master has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.14": "The Master has said that there is little enjoyment in sensual objects, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.15": "The Master has said that sensual objects are similar to a skeleton …",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.16": "similar to a piece of meat …",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.17": "similar to a grass torch …",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.18": "similar to a pit of coals …",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.24": "similar to a snake’s head; they are much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.25": "But even though the monks spoke to Ariṭṭha in this way, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.27": "And since they were not able to make him give up that view, they approached the Master and told him what had happened.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.28": "The Master then had the Sangha of monks assembled and questioned Ariṭṭha,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.29": "“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have taken a bad and erroneous view such as this:",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.30": "‘As I understand the Master’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them’?”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.31": "“Yes indeed, Venerable Sir.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.32": "“Foolish man, who do you think I have taught in this way?",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.33": "Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them?",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.34": "I have said that there is little enjoyment in sensual objects, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater.",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.45": "And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.46": "This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering.",
