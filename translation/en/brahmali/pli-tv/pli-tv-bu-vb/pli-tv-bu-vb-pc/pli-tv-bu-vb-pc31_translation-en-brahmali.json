  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.8": "Tomorrow we’ll just have to come back here.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.9": "And so they stayed on and on right there, eating alms at the guest house.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.10": "And the ascetics of other sects left.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.11": "People then complained and criticized them,",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.4": "On the second day, too, those people said to him,",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.5": "“Eat, Venerable.”",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.6": "But since he knew that",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.7": "the Master had prohibited eating alms at a public guest house after staying on and on, and because he was afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept.",
