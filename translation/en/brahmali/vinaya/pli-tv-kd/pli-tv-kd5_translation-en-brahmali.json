  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.2": "At that time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha ruled over eighty thousand villages. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.3": "And at Campā there was a prominent merchant who had a son called Soṇa Koḷivisa. He had been raised in great comfort ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.4": "and even had hairs growing on the soles of his feet. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.5": "On one occasion, because of some business, King Bimbisāra had the chiefs of those eighty thousand villages gathered. He then sent a message to Soṇa, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.1.6": "asking him to come. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.1": "Soṇa’s parents said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.2": "“Soṇa, the king wishes to see your feet, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.3": "but don’t point your feet at the King. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.4": "If you just sit down cross-legged in front of the King, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.5": "he’ll be able to see them.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.6": "And they sent him away on a palanquin. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.7": "Soṇa then approached King Bimbisāra, bowed, and sat down cross-legged in front of him. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.2.8": "And the King saw the hairs growing on the soles of his feet. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.3.1": "Then, after instructing those eighty thousand chiefs in worldly matters, the King dismissed them, saying, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.3.2": "“I’ve instructed you in worldly matters. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.3.3": "Now go and visit the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.3.4": "He will instruct us about the afterlife.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.3.5": "Those eighty thousand chiefs then went to the Vulture Peak. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.4.1": "There they approached Venerable Sāgata, who at that time was the Buddha’s attendant. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.4.2": "And they said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.4.3": "“Venerable, these eighty thousand chiefs have come to visit the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.4.4": "May we please see him.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.4.5": "“Well then, please wait here for a moment, while I announce you to the Buddha.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.5.1": "Then, while those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he sunk into the stone slab he was standing on and emerged in front of the Buddha. And he said to the Buddha, ",

  "pli-tv-kd5:1.5.3": "Please do whatever is convenient.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.5.4": "“Well then, Sāgata, please prepare a seat in the shade of the dwelling.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.6.1": "“Yes.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.6.2": "He took a stool, sunk down in front of the Buddha, and as those eighty thousand chiefs were watching, he once more emerged from that stone slab. He then prepared a seat in the shade of the dwelling, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.6.3": "and the Buddha came out and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.7.1": "Those eighty thousand chiefs approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.7.2": "But they were preoccupied with Sāgata, not with the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.7.3": "After reading the minds of those eighty thousand chiefs, the Buddha said to Sāgata, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.7.4": "“Well then, Sāgata, show us more superhuman abilities, more wonders of supernormal power.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.7.5": "Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and then disappeared. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.8.1": "After this display of supernormal powers, he bowed down at the feet of the Buddha, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.8.2": "“Venerable Sir, you’re my teacher; ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.8.3": "I’m your disciple.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.8.6": "Those eighty thousand chiefs thought, “It’s astonishing and amazing ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.8.7": "that even a disciple should be so powerful and mighty. Imagine what the teacher must be like!” And now they paid attention to the Buddha, not to Sāgata. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.1": "Having read their minds, the Buddha gave those eighty thousand chiefs a progressive teaching: ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.2": "talk on generosity, talk on morality, talk on heaven; and he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement in worldly pleasures, and the benefit of renunciation. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.3": "When the Buddha knew that their minds were ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.4": "suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.5": "And just as a clean and stainless cloth takes the dye properly, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.6": "so too, while they were sitting right there, those eighty thousand chiefs experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.9.7": "“Anything that has a beginning has an end.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.1": "They had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it; they had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.2": "“Wonderful, Venerable Sir, wonderful! ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.3": "Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.4": "those with eyes might see what’s there—",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.5": "just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.6": "We go for refuge to the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.7": "to the Teaching, and to the Sangha of monks. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.10.8": "Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.11.0": "The going forth of Soṇa Koḷivisa ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.11.1": "But Soṇa thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.11.2": "“The way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.11.3": "Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.11.4": "When those eighty-four thousand chiefs had rejoiced and expressed their appreciation for the Buddha’s teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.1": "Soon after they had left, Soṇa approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.2": "and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.3": "“Sir, the way I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, it’s not easy for one who lives at home to lead the spiritual life perfectly complete and pure as a polished conch shell. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.4": "I want to cut off my hair and beard, put on the ocher robes, and go forth from home into homelessness. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.5": "Please give me the going forth.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.6": "And Soṇa received the going forth and the full ordination in the Buddha’s presence. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.12.7": "Soon after his ordination, while staying in Cool Grove, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.1": "Venerable Soṇa walked up and down with so much energy that his feet cracked. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.2": "His walking-path was soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.3": "Then, while he was in seclusion, he thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.4": "“I’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.5": "yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.6": "But my family is wealthy. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.13.8": "Perhaps I should return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.1": "Just then the Buddha read Soṇa’s mind. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.2": "And, as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and appeared in Cool Grove. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.3": "Soon afterwards as the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, they came to Soṇa’s walking-path. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.4": "The Buddha looked at it and asked the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.5": "“Whose walking-path is this? It’s soaked in blood, as if a slaughterhouse.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.14.6": "And they told him what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.1": "The Buddha then approached Soṇa’s dwelling and sat down on a prepared seat. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.2": "Soṇa bowed and sat down, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.3": "and the Buddha said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.4": "“Soṇa, when you were in seclusion, didn’t you think, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.5": "ʻI’m one of the Buddha’s energetic disciples, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.6": "yet my mind isn’t freed from the corruptions without grasping. ",

  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.9": "Perhaps I should return to the lower life, enjoy wealth, and make merit’?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.10": "“Yes, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.11": "“Think about it, Soṇa. When you were previously a householder, weren’t you a skilled lute player?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.12": "“Yes.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.13": "“When the strings were too tight, was the lute melodious and easy to play?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.15.14": "“No.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.16.1": "“When the strings were too loose, was the lute melodious and easy to play?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.16.2": "“No.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.16.3": "“But when the strings were neither too tight nor too loose, but set to a balanced tension, was the lute then melodious and easy to play?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.16.4": "“Yes.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.16.5": "“Just so, Soṇa, too much energy leads to restlessness and too little to laziness. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.17.1": "So exert a balanced energy and discover an evenness of the spiritual faculties. And that is where you should take up the meditation object.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.17.2": "“Yes, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.17.3": "Then, as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so too the Buddha disappeared from the presence of Soṇa in Cool Grove and appeared on the Vulture Peak. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.18.1": "After some time, Soṇa exerted a balanced energy, discovered an evenness of the spiritual faculties, and that is where he took up his meditation object. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.18.2": "He then stayed by himself, secluded, heedful, energetic, and diligent. And in this very life, he soon realized with his own insight the supreme goal of the spiritual life for which people from good families rightly go forth from home to homelessness. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.18.3": "He understood that birth had come to an end, that the spiritual life had been lived, that the job had been done, that there was no further state of existence. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.18.4": "And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected ones. ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.19.1": "After attaining perfection, Soṇa thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.19.2": "“Let me declare perfect insight in the presence of the Buddha.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd5:1.19.3": "He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, ",
