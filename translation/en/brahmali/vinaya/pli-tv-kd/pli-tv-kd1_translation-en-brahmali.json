  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.1": "Just then an unseasonal storm was approaching, bringing seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.2": "Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode. He encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.3": "“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be bothered by horseflies or mosquitoes, by the wind or the burning sun, or by creeping animals or insects.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.3.1": "After seven days, when he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddha’s body and transformed himself into a young brahmin. He then stood in front of the Buddha, raising his joined palms in veneration. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.3.2": "Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.1": "Just then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that area. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.2": "Then a god who was a former relative of theirs said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.3": "“Sirs, a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an ape-flower tree. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.4": "Go to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honey. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.5": "That will be for your benefit and happiness for a long time.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.1": "And they took baked goods and honey and went to the Buddha. They bowed down ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.2": "and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.3": "“Venerable Sir, please accept the baked goods and honey from us. That will be for our benefit and happiness for a long time.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.1": "The Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.2": "“Buddhas don’t receive with their hands. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.3": "In what should I receive the baked goods and honey?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.4": "Then, reading the mind of the Buddha, the four great kings offered him four crystal bowls from the four directions, saying, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.5": "“Here, Sir, please receive the baked goods and honey in these.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.6": "After receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable crystal bowls, the Buddha ate them. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.1": "When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.2": "“Sir, we go for refuge to the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.3": "By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.4": "The account with the ape-flower tree is finished. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.0": "5. The account of the supreme being’s request ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.1": "After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the ape-flower tree to a goatherd’s banyan tree, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.2": "and he stayed there. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.1": "Then, while reflecting in private, the Buddha thought this: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2": "“I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It’s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.3": "But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.4": "and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.5": "This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.6": "If I were to teach this truth, others would not understand, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.1": "And spontaneously, these verses never heard before occurred to the Buddha: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.2": "“What I’ve discovered with difficulty, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.3": "There’s no point in making it known. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.4": "For those overcome by sensual desire and ill will, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.5": "This truth is hard to understand. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.6": "Those who are excited by sensual desire, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.7": "Obstructed by a mass of darkness, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.8": "Won’t see what goes against the stream, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.9": "What’s subtle and refined, profound and hard to see.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.1": "When the Buddha reflected like this, he inclined to inactivity, not to teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.2": "Just then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha. He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.3": "“The world is lost; it’s perished!—for the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, inclines to inaction, not to teaching.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.5.1": "Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, so Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.1": "He put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.2": "“Please teach, Venerable Sir, please teach! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.3": "There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.1": "This is what Sahampati said, and he added: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.2": "“Earlier, among the Magadhans, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.3": "An impure teaching appeared, conceived by defiled people. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.4": "Open this door to the deathless! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.5": "Let them hear the Teaching, discovered by the Pure One. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.6": "Just as one standing on a rocky mountain top ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.7": "Would see the people all around, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.8": "Just so, All-seeing Wise One, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.9": "Ascend the temple of the Truth. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.10": "Being rid of sorrow, look upon the people, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.11": "Sunk in grief, overcome by birth and old age. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.12": "Stand up, Victorious Hero! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.13": "Leader of travelers, wander the world without obligation. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.14": "Sir, proclaim the Teaching; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.15": "There will be those who understand.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.1": "Twice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.4": "",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.5": "",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.6": "",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.9.1": "and on both occasions Sahampati repeated his request. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.9.53": "",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.10.1": "The Buddha understood the request of that supreme being. Then, with the eye of a Buddha, he surveyed the world out of compassion for sentient beings. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.11.1": "He saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and difficult to teach. He even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoided, while others did not. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.11.2": "It was just like blue, red, and white lotuses, sprouted and grown in a lotus pond: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, while others still rise out of the water without being touched by it. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.1": "When he had seen this, the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verse: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.2": "“Open to them are the doors to the deathless! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.3": "May those who hear release their faith. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.4": "Seeing trouble, supreme being, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.5": "I did not speak the sublime and subtle Truth.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.1": "Sahampati thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.2": "“The Buddha has consented to teach.” He bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and disappeared right there. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.3": "The account of the supreme being’s request is finished. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.0": "6. The account of the group of five ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.1": "The Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.5": "“Ālāra Kālāma is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.6": "Let me teach him first. He will understand it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.1": "But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Ālāra Kālāma died seven days ago,” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.2": "and the Buddha also knew this for himself. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.3": "He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.4": "“Ālāra Kālāma’s loss is great. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.5": "If he had heard this Teaching, he would have understood it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.1": "Again the Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.5": "“Udaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.6": "Let me teach him first. He will understand it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.1": "But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Udaka Rāmaputta died last night,” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.2": "and the Buddha also knew this for himself. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.3": "He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.4": "“Udaka Rāmaputta’s loss is great. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.5": "If he had heard this Teaching, he would have understood it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.1": "Once again the Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.5": "“The group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to me. ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.3": "But where are they staying now?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.4": "With his superhuman and purified clairvoyance, the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.5": "Then, after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.1": "The Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening. He said to the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.2": "“Sir, your senses are clear and your skin is pure and bright. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.3": "In whose name have you gone forth? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.4": "Who is your teacher ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.5": "or whose teaching do you follow?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.1": "The Buddha replied to Upaka in verse: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.2": "“I’m the victor, the knower of all. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.3": "Abandoning all, I’m not soiled by anything. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.4": "Through my own insight, I’m freed by the ending of craving—",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.5": "So who should I refer to as a teacher? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.6": "I have no teacher; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.7": "No-one like me exists. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.8": "In the world with its gods, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.9": "I have no equal. ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.1": "The Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares. When he eventually arrived, he went to the group of five monks. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.2": "Seeing him coming, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.3": "the group of five made an agreement with one another: ",
