  "pli-tv-kd17:1.4.2": "After going a good distance, they turned back the army. They then entered a foreign territory, removed their ornaments, bound them in a bundle with an upper robe, and said to Upāli, ",

  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.11": "This is why I say this.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.13": "Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.14": "“They who have no anger within, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.15": "Gone beyond any kind of existence, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.16": "Happy, free from fear and sorrow—",
