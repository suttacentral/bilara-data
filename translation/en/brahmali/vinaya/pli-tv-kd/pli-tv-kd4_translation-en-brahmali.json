  "pli-tv-kd4:1.1.2": "At that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainy-season residence together. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.1.3": "They thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.1.4": "“How can we remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.2.1": "Then it occurred to them, ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.2.2": "“Let’s not talk to one another. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.2.3": "Whoever returns first from almsround in the village should prepare the seats and set out a foot-stool, a foot-scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and set it out, and put out water for drinking and water for washing. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.3.1": "Whoever returns last from almsround may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.3.2": "He should put away the seats and also the foot-stool, the foot-scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should clean the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.4.1": "Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the waterpot in the restroom is empty should fill it. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.4.2": "If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal and they should fill it together. ",

  "pli-tv-kd4:1.4.4": "In this way we’ll remain united and in harmony, have a comfortable rains residence, and get almsfood without trouble.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.5.1": "And they did just that. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.8.1": "Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.8.2": "So when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and left for Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.8.3": "When they eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.8.4": "Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.9.1": "the Buddha said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.9.2": "“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable; ",

  "pli-tv-kd4:1.10.3": "Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial, ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.10.4": "for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. ",

  "pli-tv-kd4:1.10.6": "And the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, without having any trouble getting almsfood?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.12.1": "When they had told him, the Buddha addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-kd4:1.12.2": "“While they dwelt in discomfort these foolish men claim they were dwelling in comfort. ",
