  "pli-tv-kd8:1.1.2": "At that time Vesālī was prosperous and crowded with people, and there was plenty of food. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.1.3": "There were seven thousand seven hundred and seven stilt houses, ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.4.4": "Saying, “Yes, madam,” she did just that. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.4.5": "On the same morning, as Prince Abhaya was walking to an audience with the King, he saw that boy surrounded by crows. He asked his companions, ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.4.10": "“Well then, take him to our compound and give him to the wet-nurses to feed.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.4.11": "Saying, “Yes,” that’s what they did. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.4.13": "When they knew that he would live, they gave him the name Jīvaka, “Survivor”. ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.5.6": "because I brought you up.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.5.7": "On a later occasion Jīvaka thought, ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.1": "Then, without asking permission of Prince Abhaya, Jīvaka left for Takkasilā. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.2": "When he eventually arrived, he went to that physician and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.3": "“Teacher, I wish to learn the profession.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.4": "“Well then, Jīvaka, please do so.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.5": "Jīvaka learned much, and he learned quickly; he remembered well and did not forget. ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.7": "“I’m a good learner, and I’ve been studying for seven years. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.6.8": "And yet there’s no end in sight of learning this profession.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.1": "He went to that physician and told him what he had thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.3": "adding, “When will I complete the training for this profession?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.4": "“Listen, Jīvaka. Take a spade and walk as far as 13 kilometers all around Takkasilā and bring back whatever plant you see that’s not medicinal.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.5": "Saying, “Yes, teacher,” he did just that. But he did not see any plant that was not medicinal. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.6": "He then went back to the physician and told him what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.8": "The physician said, “You are well-trained, Jīvaka. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.7.9": "This is enough for you to live on.” And he gave Jīvaka a small amount of provisions for the journey. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.1": "Jīvaka left for Rājagaha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.2": "but the provisions were exhausted by the time he got to Sāketa. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.3": "Jīvaka thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.4": "“These roads go through the wilderness where there’s little water and little food. It’s not easy to travel there without provisions. ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.7": "Many of the most famous physicians in the world had come to see her, but none were able to cure her. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.8": "And they were very expensive. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.9": "When Jīvaka arrived at Sāketa, he asked people, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.10": "“Is there anyone who is sick whom I might cure?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.11": "“There’s a prominent merchant whose wife has had a headache for seven years. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.8.12": "Go, doctor, and cure her.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.1": "Jīvaka went to that merchant’s house and told the doorman, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.2": "“Go and say this to the merchant’s wife, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.3": "‘Madam, a doctor has arrived. He wishes to see you.’” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.4": "Saying, “Yes, doctor,” he did as asked. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.7": "When she had been told, she asked, “What sort of doctor is it?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.8": "“A young one.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.9": "“Forget it. I don’t need a young doctor. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.10": "Many of the most famous physicians in the world have been here, but none were able to cure me. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.9.11": "And they were very expensive too.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.10.1": "The doorman then returned to Jīvaka and told him what the merchant’s wife had said. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.10.6": "Jīvaka replied, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.10.7": "“Go and tell her ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.11.3": "She got him a handful of ghee. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.11.4": "Jīvaka cooked that ghee with a number of medicines. He then got her to lie down on her back on a bed, and he gave her the medicine through the nose. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.11.5": "The medicine emerged in her mouth. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.11.6": "She then spat it out into a receptacle and told a slave, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.11.7": "“Listen, take this ghee in a cotton wadding.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.12.1": "Jīvaka thought, ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:1.13.8": "The merchant also gave him a male and a female slave and a carriage with horses. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.13.9": "Jīvaka took those sixteen thousand coins, as well as the male and female slaves and the carriage with horses, and he left for Rājagaha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.13.10": "When he eventually arrived, he went to Prince Abhaya and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:1.13.11": "“For my first job, sir, I earned sixteen thousand coins, a male and a female slave, and a carriage with horses. ",
