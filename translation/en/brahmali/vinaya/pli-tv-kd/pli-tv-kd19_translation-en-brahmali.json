  "pli-tv-kd19:1.3.12": "When the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.3.15": "Whatever rivers in the world flow into the ocean and whatever rain falls into it, the ocean isn’t diminished or filled up because of that. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.3.18": "The ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.3.21": "The ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes. ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.1": "“Just so, the monks delight in this spiritual path because they see eight amazing qualities in it: ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.3": "Just as the ocean slopes and inclines gradually, and doesn’t drop off all at once, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.4": "so too, on this spiritual path, the training is gradual, the practice is gradual, and penetration to perfect insight doesn’t happen all at once. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.7": "Just as the ocean is steady and doesn’t go beyond the shoreline, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.8": "so too, on this spiritual path, my disciples don’t transgress the training rules I’ve laid down, even for the sake of life. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.11": "Just as the ocean doesn’t tolerate dead bodies, but quickly carries them to the shore and dumps them on dry land, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.12": "so too, the Sangha of monks doesn’t associate with anyone who is immoral—someone with bad qualities, impure and dubious in conduct, hiding his actions, not a monastic while claiming to be one, not abstaining from sexuality while claiming to do so, rotten inside, lustful, defiled. When the Sangha has gathered, they quickly eject him. Even if seated in the midst of the Sangha, he’s far from the Sangha and the Sangha is far from him. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.15": "Just as when the great rivers—the Ganges, the Yamunā, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, or the Mahī—reach the ocean, they lose their former names and become known simply as the ocean, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.16": "so too, when anyone goes forth on this spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha—whether an aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, or worker—they lose their former name and class and become known simply as a Sakyan monastic. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.19": "Just as the ocean doesn’t decrease or fill up because of all the rivers in the world that flow into it or the rain that falls into it, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.20": "so too, even if many monks are extinguished without remainder, there’s no decrease or filling up of the element of extinguishment. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.23": "Just as the ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.24": "so too, this spiritual path has only one taste, the taste of freedom. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.27": "Just as the ocean contains many precious things—pearls, gems, beryls, mother-of-pearls, quartz, corals, silver, gold, rubies, and cat’s eyes—",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.28": "so too, this spiritual path contains many precious things—the four applications of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four foundations for supernormal power, the five spiritual faculties, the five spiritual powers, the seven factors of awakening, and the noble eightfold path. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.31": "Just as there are great beings in the ocean—sea monsters, antigods, dragons, and fairies; creatures with bodies one thousand kilometers long, two thousand, three thousand, four thousand, and five thousand kilometers long—",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.32": "so too, there are great beings on this spiritual path—stream-enterers, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of stream-entry; once-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of once-returning; non-returners, those practicing for the realization of the fruit of non-returning; perfected ones, and those practicing for the realization of the fruit of perfection.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.36": "Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.37": "“It rains on what’s concealed, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.38": "Not on what’s revealed. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:1.4.39": "Therefore, reveal the concealed, ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.3": "You should do it instead. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.4": "It’s impossible for the Buddha to do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code in an impure gathering. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.5": "And, monks, you shouldn’t listen to the Monastic Code if you have an unconfessed offense. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.6": "If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.7": "If anyone who has an unconfessed offense listens to the Monastic Code, I allow you to cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.8": "And it should be done like this. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.9": "On the observance day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the midst of the Sangha and in the presence of that person, you should announce: ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.10": "‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:2.1.11": "The person so-and-so has an unconfessed offense. I cancel his hearing of the Monastic Code. The Monastic Code shouldn’t be recited in his presence.’ Then his hearing of the Monastic Code is canceled.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.1": "Soon afterwards, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.2": "thinking that nobody knew about them, the monks from the group of six listened to the Monastic Code while having unconfessed offenses. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.3": "The senior monks who could read the minds of others ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.4": "informed the monks about this. ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.6": "When they heard about it, ",
  "pli-tv-kd19:3.1.12": "the monks from the group of six tried to pre-empt the pure monks by, without reason, canceling their hearing of the Monastic Code. ",
