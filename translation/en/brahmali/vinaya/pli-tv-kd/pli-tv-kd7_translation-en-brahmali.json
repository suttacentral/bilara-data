  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.2": "At that time thirty monks from Pāvā—all wilderness-dwellers, almsfood-only eaters, rag-robe wearers, and three-robe owners—were traveling to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha. Because the entry to the rainy-season residence was approaching, they were not able to reach Sāvatthī, ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.3": "and they entered the rains residence at Sāketa while still on their way. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.4": "They spent the rains residence discontented, thinking, “The Buddha is only 80 kilometers away, but we don’t get to see him.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.5": "When they had completed the rainy-season residence and done the invitation procedure at the end of the three months, it was raining, water was accumulating, and it was muddy. As they traveled to Sāvatthī, their robes were soaked. They became exhausted. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.1.6": "When they arrived at Sāvatthī, they went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, bowed to the Buddha, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.1": "Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.2": "the Buddha said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.3": "“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable; ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.4": "I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.5": "“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable; ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.6": "we had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.2.7": "And they told the Buddha what had happened during the rains and while traveling to Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.3.1": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.3.2": "“I allow monks who have completed the rainy-season residence to do a robe-making procedure. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.3.3": "Once you have participated in the robe-making procedure, five things are allowable for you: ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.3.4": "visiting families before or after a meal invitation, staying apart from your robe for more than a day, eating in a group, keeping as much extra robe-cloth as you need, and whatever robe-cloth is given is only for those who have participated in the robe-making procedure. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.3.6": "And the robe-making procedure should be done like this. ",

  "pli-tv-kd7:1.4.4": "If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should give this cloth to monk so-and-so to do the robe-making procedure. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.4.5": "This is the motion. ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.4.6": "Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. ",

  "pli-tv-kd7:1.5.2": "“And, monks, how has the robe-making procedure not been done? ",
  "pli-tv-kd7:1.5.3": "The robe-making procedure hasn’t been done merely by marking the cloth, ",
