  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.1": "At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.2": "Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha wanted to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.3": "He went to the nuns and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.4": "“Venerables, I wish to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.5": "Please give me the nun in charge of building work.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.6": "At that time four sisters had gone forth as nuns: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.7": "Nandā, Nandavatī, Sundarīnandā, and Thullanandā. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.8": "Of these, the nun Sundarīnandā had gone forth when she was young, and she was beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent, and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things well. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.9": "After appointing Sundarīnandā to be in charge of building work, the Sangha made her work with Sāḷha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.10": "As a consequence of this, Sundarīnandā would often go to Sāḷha’s house to ask for tools, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.11": "whether an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.12": "And Sāḷha would often go to the nuns’ dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building work. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.13": "And because they saw each other frequently, they fell in love. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.14": "But because Sāḷha could not find any opportunity to be intimate with Sundarīnandā, he invited the Sangha of nuns for a meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.15": "When preparing the seats in the dining hall, he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable Sundarīnandā and placed their seats to one side, and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seat on the other side. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.16": "He then placed Sundarīnandā’s seat in a concealed spot in a corner. In this way the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior ones. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.17": "Soon afterwards he informed the Sangha that the meal was ready. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.18": "Sundarīnandā thought, “Sāḷha hasn’t prepared a meal for the Sangha as a service, but because he wants to be intimate with me. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.19": "If I go, I will get into trouble.” She then told a nun who was her pupil, “Go and bring back almsfood for me. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.20": "If anyone asks about me, tell them I’m sick.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.21": "“Yes, Venerable,” she replied. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.22": "Soon afterwards Sāḷha was standing outside the gateway of his house repeatedly inquiring after Sundarīnandā: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.23": "“Venerables, where’s Venerable Sundarīnandā?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.24": "The nun who was Sundarīnandā’s pupil told him: “She’s sick. I’m bringing her almsfood.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.25": "Sāḷha thought, “I invited the Sangha of nuns because of Sundarīnandā,” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.26": "and after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Sangha of nuns, he left for the nuns’ dwelling place. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.27": "Just then Sundarīnandā was standing outside the monastery gateway longing for Sāḷha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.28": "When she saw him coming, she entered the dwelling, put on her upper robe so that it covered her head, and lay down on her bed. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.29": "Sāḷha approached her and said, “Venerable, what’s wrong with you? Why are you lying down?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.30": "“That’s what happens when you desire someone who doesn’t desire you in return.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.31": "“What do you mean I don’t desire you? ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.32": "I just couldn’t find an opportunity to be intimate with you.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.33": "And both having lust, he made physical contact with Sundarīnandā. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.34": "Just then a nun who was weak from old age and had problems with her feet was lying down not far from Sundarīnandā. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.35": "She saw how Sāḷha made physical contact with Sundarīnandā while both of them had lust. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.36": "She complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.37": "That nun then told the nuns what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.38": "The nuns of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.39": "“How could Venerable Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.40": "Those nuns then told the monks. And the monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, criticized her in the same way. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.41": "After criticizing the nun Sundarīnandā in many ways, they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.42": "Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.43": "“Is it true, monks, that the nun Sundarīnandā acted like this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.44": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.45": "The Buddha criticized her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.46": "“It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun Sundarīnandā, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.47": "How could Sundarīnandā consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust? ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.48": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it or increase the confidence of those who have it, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.49": "but it will hinder confidence in those without it, and it will cause some with confidence to change their minds.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.50": "And the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-elimination, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and of being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.51": "“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.52": "for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad nuns, for the ease of good nuns, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.53": "And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5:1.54.1": "‘If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community.
