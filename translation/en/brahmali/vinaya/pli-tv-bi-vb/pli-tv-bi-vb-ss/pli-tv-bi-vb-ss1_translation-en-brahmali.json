  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.2": "At that time a lay follower who had given a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns had died. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.3": "He had two sons, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.4": "one with and one without faith and confidence, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.5": "and they divided their father’s property between them. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.6": "Then the one without faith said to the other, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.7": "“The storehouse is ours; let’s share it out.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.8": "But the one with faith responded, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.9": "“No, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.10": "our father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.11": "A second time they both said the same thing, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.16": "and a third time the one without faith repeated his proposal. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.18": "The one with faith then thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.19": "“If I get it, I too would give it to the Sangha of nuns,” ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.21": "“Let’s share it out.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.22": "But when they shared out that storehouse, it fell to the one without faith. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.24": "“Please depart, Venerables, this storehouse is mine.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.25": "The nun Thullanandā said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.26": "“No, your father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.27": "Because they were unable to agree, they asked judges to decide on the matter. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.33": "“It’s true what the Venerable says,” the judges made the storehouse the property of the Sangha of nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.34": "The defeated man complained and criticized the nuns, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.35": "“They’re not ascetics these shaven-headed sluts. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.39": "That man then made a dwelling place for Ājīvaka ascetics not far from the nuns, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.40": "inciting them to abuse the nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.41": "Once again Thullanandā told the judges ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.42": "and the judges jailed him. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1:1.43": "People then complained and criticized those nuns, ",
