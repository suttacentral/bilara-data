  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.2": "At that time in Vesālī the wife of a certain Licchavī man was unfaithful. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.3": "He said to her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.4": "“Please stop. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.5": "But she did not listen. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.6": "Just then in Vesālī the Licchavī clan had gathered on some business. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.7": "That Licchavī man said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.8": "“Sirs, please give me permission in regard to one of my wives.” ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.10": "“She’s unfaithful. I wish to kill her.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.11": "“You may go ahead.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.12": "When his wife heard ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.13": "that her husband wanted to kill her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.14": "she took their most valuable possessions and went to Sāvatthī. There she approached ascetics of other religions and asked for the going forth, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.15": "but they refused. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.16": "She then went to the Buddhist nuns and again asked for the going forth, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.17": "but they too refused. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.18": "She then went to the nun Thullanandā, showed her the goods, and once again asked for the going forth. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.19": "Thullanandā took the goods and gave her the going forth. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.20": "That Licchavī man then went to Sāvatthī in search of his wife. When he saw that she had been given the going forth as a nun, he went to King Pasenadi of Kosala ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.21": "and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.22": "“Sir, my wife took my most valuable possessions and came to Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.23": "Please permit me to deal with her.” ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.26": "“If she’s gone forth as a nun, there’s nothing that can be done. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.27": "The Teaching of the Buddha is well-proclaimed. Let her practice the spiritual life for the full ending of suffering.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.28": "Then that Licchavī man complained and criticized the nuns, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.29": "“How can the nuns give the going forth to a criminal?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.30": "The nuns heard the complaints of that Licchavī man, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.31": "and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.32": "“How could Venerable Thullanandā give the going forth to a criminal?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2:1.33": "The nuns told the monks. … ",
