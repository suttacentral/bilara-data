  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.3": "Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.4": "When the three months were over and they had completed the rainy-season residence, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and sticks, and left to wander the country. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.5": "But Venerable Dhaniya spent the winter and the summer right  there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.6": "Then, on one occasion, while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished his grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.7": "A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.8": "and again the hut was demolished in the same way. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.13": "But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.14": "Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut entirely of clay?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.15": "And he did just that. He then collected grass, sticks, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.20": "“You may take it, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.21": "Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces, took it away on carts, and made a wooden hut. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.1": "Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, was inspecting the public works in Rājagaha when he went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.5": "Vassakāra was upset and thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.6": "“How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.7": "He then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, ",
