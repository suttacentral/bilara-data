  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.2": "At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainy-season residence there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.3": "Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.4": "After three months, when they had completed the rainy-season residence, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and wood, and left to wander in the country. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.5": "But Venerable Dhaniya also spent the winter and the summer there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.6": "Then, on one occasion, while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished the grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.7": "A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.8": "and again the hut was demolished in the same way. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.9": "The same thing happened a third time. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.11": "Dhaniya thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.12": "“Three times this has happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.13": "But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.14": "Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut consisting of nothing but clay?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.15": "Then Dhaniya did just that. And he collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.16": "It was a beautiful and charming little hut, and it was red just like a scarlet rain-mite. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.1.17": "And when hit it sounded just like the sound of a bell. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.1": "Soon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks and he saw that hut. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.2": "He said to the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.3": "“Monks, what’s this beautiful and charming thing, which is red like a scarlet rain-mite?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.4": "The monks told the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.5": "and the Buddha criticized Dhaniya: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.6": "“It’s not suitable, monks, for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.7": "How can he make a hut out of nothing but clay? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.8": "Certainly that foolish man can have no consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.9": "Go, monks, and demolish this hut, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.10": "so that future generations don’t take up the destruction of living beings. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.11": "And, monks, you should not make a hut consisting of nothing but clay. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.12": "If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.13": "“Yes, Venerable Sir,” the monks replied, and they went to that hut and demolished it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.14": "Dhaniya said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.15": "“Why are you demolishing my hut?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.16": "“The Buddha has asked us to.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.2.17": "“Demolish it, if the Lord of the Truth has said so.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.1": "Then Dhaniya thought, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.3": "And now my hut made of nothing but clay has been demolished at the Buddha’s request. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.4": "But the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mine. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.5": "Why don’t I ask him for timber and make a hut out of that?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.6": "Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happened, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.9": "adding, “Please give me some timber, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.10": "I want to make a wooden hut.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.11": "“There’s no such timber, Sir, that I could give you. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.12": "This timber is held by the King, and it’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.13": "You can only take it if the King gives it away.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.14": "“It’s been given by the King.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.15": "The caretaker of the woodyard thought, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.17": "Even the King has faith in them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.18": "These venerables wouldn’t say something is given if it were not.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.19": "And he said to Dhaniya, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.20": "“You may take it, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.3.21": "Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces, removed it by means of carts, and made a wooden hut. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.1": "Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, while inspecting the works in Rājagaha, went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said to him: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.2": "“What’s going on? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.3": "Where’s the timber held by the King that’s meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.4": "“Sir, that timber was given by the King to Venerable Dhaniya.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.5": "The brahmin Vassakāra was upset and thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.6": "“How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.7": "The brahmin Vassakāra then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.8": "“Is it true, sir, that the timber held by the King, meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency, was given by the King to Dhaniya the potter?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.9": "“Who said that?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.10": "“The caretaker of the woodyard, sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.11": "“Well then, brahmin, send for the caretaker of the woodyard.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.12": "And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by force. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.13": "Dhaniya saw the caretaker of the woodyard being bound and taken by force, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.14": "and he said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.15": "“Why is this happening to you?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.16": "“Because of that business with the timber, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.17": "“Go, and I’ll come too.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.4.18": "“Please come before I’m done for.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.1": "Dhaniya then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.2": "The King approached Dhaniya, bowed, sat down, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.3": "and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.4": "“Is it true, Venerable, that I have given the timber held by the King—meant for the repair of the town and put aside in case of an emergency—to you?” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.6": "“We kings are very busy—",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.11": "“I remember. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.5.12": "There are ascetics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.1": "But people complained and criticized him: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.12": "After criticizing Dhaniya in many ways, they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.13": "The Buddha then convened the Sangha of monks and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.21": "Just then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.22": "The Buddha said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2:1.6.23": "“For what amount of stealing does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?” ",
