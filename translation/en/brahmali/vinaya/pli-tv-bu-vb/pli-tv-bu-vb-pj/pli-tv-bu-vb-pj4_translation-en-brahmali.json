  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.3": "Just then Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.36": "Indeed, this is the better way, that we praise one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.37": "Then those monks praised one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.39": "such a monk has the six direct knowledges.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.40": "And those people thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.41": "“We’re fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainy-season residence. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.42": "Such monks as these, who are virtuous and of good character, have never before entered the rains residence with us.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.43": "And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.1.45": "In this way those monks were satisfied, with a good color, a bright face, and clear skin. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.1": "Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.2": "So when they had completed the rains residence and the three months had elapsed, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and left for Vesālī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.3": "When they eventually arrived at Vesālī, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.4": "At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin, haggard, and pale, their veins protruding all over their limbs. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.5": "But the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā were satisfied, with a good color, a bright face, and clear skin. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.6": "Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.7": "the Buddha said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.8": "“I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re comfortable; ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.9": "I hope you had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and that you had no trouble getting almsfood?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.10": "“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re comfortable; ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.11": "we had a comfortable rains residence, in concord and harmony, without dispute, and we had no trouble getting almsfood.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.12": "When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not; they know the right time to ask and the right time not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, not when it is unbeneficial, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.13": "Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.14": "And the Buddha said to those monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.15": "“In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable rains residence, without having any trouble getting almsfood?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.16": "Then those monks told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.17": "“But had you really achieved those superhuman qualities?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.18": "“No, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.19": "The Buddha rebuked them, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.20": "“It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it’s should not be done. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.21": "How can you for the sake of your stomachs praise one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.22": "It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to praise one another’s superhuman qualities to householders. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.23": "Why is that? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.24": "Because for that reason you might die or experience death-like suffering, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.25": "but you wouldn’t because of that be reborn in a bad destination. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.26": "But for *this* reason you might. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.27": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it …” … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.2.28": "After rebuking them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.1": "“Monks, there are these five great gangsters to be found in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.2": "What five? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.3": "A great gangster thinks like this: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.4": "‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, wander among villages, towns, and royal capitals, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.5": "killing and making others kill, destroying and making others destroy, tormenting and making others torment?’ ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.6": "Then after some time, he does just that. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.7": "Just so, monks, a bad monk thinks like this: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.8": "‘Oh when will I, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, go wandering among villages, towns, and royal capitals; ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.9": "be honored, respected, and revered by both lay people and those gone forth; and obtain robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines?’ ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.10": "Then after some time, he does just that. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.11": "This is the first great gangster to be found in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.12": "Again, a bad monk learns the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.13": "This is the second great gangster to be found in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.14": "Again, a bad monk groundlessly charges someone who lives the spiritual life in purity with not abstaining from sexuality. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.15": "This is the third great gangster to be found in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.16": "Again, a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites belonging to the Sangha—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.17": "a monastery, the site of a monastery, a dwelling, the site of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a mattress, a pillow, a metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, earthenware goods—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.18": "and uses them to win over and create a following among householders. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.19": "This is the fourth great gangster to be found in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.20": "But in this world with its gods, its lords of death, and its supreme beings, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this is the greatest gangster: one who untruthfully and groundlessly boasts about a superhuman quality. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.21": "Why is that? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj4:1.3.22": "Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.” ",
