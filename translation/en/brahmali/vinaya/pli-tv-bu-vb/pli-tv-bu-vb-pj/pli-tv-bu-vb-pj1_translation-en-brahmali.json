  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1": "At that time Verañjā was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.2": "Just then some horse dealers from Uttarāpatha had entered the rainy-season residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.3": "In the horse pen they prepared portion upon portion of steamed grain for the monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.4": "Then, after robing up in the morning, the monks took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Not getting anything, they went to the horse pen. They then brought back many portions of steamed grain to the monastery, where they pounded and ate them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.5": "Venerable Ānanda crushed a portion on a stone, took it to the Buddha, and the Buddha ate it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.6": "And the Buddha heard the sound of the mortar. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.9": "Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.12": "And so the he said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, what’s this sound of a mortar?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.13": "Ānanda told him what was happening. ",
