  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.0.2": "First sub-story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.2": "At that time the Buddha spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness—he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, in praise of developing the mind in unattractiveness, and in praise of the attainment of unattractiveness. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.3": "The Buddha then addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.4": "“Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.5": "No-one is to approach me except the one who brings me almsfood.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.6": "“Yes, Venerable Sir,” they replied, and no-one approached him except the one who brought him almsfood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.7": "The monks thought, “The Buddha has talked in many ways about unattractiveness,” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.8": "and they devoted themselves to the development of the mind in unattractiveness in its many different facets. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.9": "As a consequence, they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of them, disgusted with them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.10": "Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, who had just washed her hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcase of a snake, a dog, or a man were hung around her neck, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.11": "just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.12": "They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.13": "and they approached Migalaṇḍika, the ascetic lookalike, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.14": "“Please kill us. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.15": "This bowl and these robe will be yours.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.16": "And hired for a bowl and robes, Migalaṇḍika killed a number of monks. He took his blood-stained knife to the river Vaggumudā, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.17": "and while he was washing it, he became anxious and remorseful: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.18": "“This is truly bad for me; ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.19": "I’ve made much demerit by killing virtuous monks.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.20": "Then, walking across the water, a god from the realm of the lord of death said to Migalaṇḍika, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.21": "“Well done, superior man, you’re truly fortunate. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.22": "You’ve made much merit, because you’ve brought across those who hadn’t yet crossed.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.23": "And Migalaṇḍika thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.24": "“So it seems that I’m fortunate, that I’ve made much merit.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.25": "He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from precincts to precincts, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.26": "“Who hasn’t crossed yet? Whom do I bring across?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.27": "The monks who still had sensual desire became fearful and terrified, with their hair standing on end. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.28": "Only those who were free from desires were unaffected. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.1.29": "Then, on a single day, Migalaṇḍika killed one monk, two monks, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.1": "At the end of that half-month, the Buddha came out of seclusion and said to Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.2": "“Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so diminished?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.3": "Ānanda told him what had happened, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.13": "adding, “Venerable Sir, please give another instruction so that the Sangha of monks may become established in perfect insight.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.14": "“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly hall all those monks who live supported by Vesālī.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.15": "“Yes.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.16": "When he had done so, he approached the Buddha and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.17": "“Sir, the Sangha of monks is gathered. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.18": "Please do as you think is appropriate.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.2.19": "The Buddha then went to the assembly hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.1": "“Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of bliss. And it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.2": "Just as a great, unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season stops and settles the dust and dirt in the air, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.3": "just so, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.4": "And how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated like this? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.5": "A monk sits down in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut. He crosses his legs, straightens his body, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.6": "Simply mindful, he breathes in; mindful, he breathes out. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.7": "When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.8": "When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.9": "When breathing in, he trains in having the full experience of the breath; when breathing out, he trains in having the full experience of the breath. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.10": "When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.11": "When breathing in, he trains in experiencing joy; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing joy. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.12": "When breathing in, he trains in experiencing bliss; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing bliss. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.13": "When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.14": "When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.15": "When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.16": "When breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; when breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.17": "When breathing in, he trains in stilling the mind; when breathing out, he trains in stilling the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.18": "When breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.19": "When breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.20": "When breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.21": "When breathing in, he trains in contemplating ending; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating ending. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.22": "When breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.23": "Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated like this, it is peaceful and sublime, a satisfying state of bliss, and it stops and settles bad, unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.1": "The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.2": "“Is it true, monks, that some monks have taken their own lives, have killed one another, and have said to Migalaṇḍika, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.3": "‘Please kill us; this bowl and these robes will be yours’?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.4": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.6": "“Monks, it’s not suitable for these monks, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of an ascetic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.7": "How could those monks take their own lives, kill one another, and say to Migalaṇḍika, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.8": "‘Please kill us; this bowl and these robes will be yours’? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.9": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.10": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.12": "he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.4.13": "In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. ",
