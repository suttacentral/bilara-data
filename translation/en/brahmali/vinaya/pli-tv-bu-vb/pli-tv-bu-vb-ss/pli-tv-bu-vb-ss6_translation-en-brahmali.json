  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.2": "At that time the monks of Āḷavī were building huts by means of begging. The huts were intended for themselves, did not have a sponsoring owner, and were inappropriate in size. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.3": "Moreover, they were never finished, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.4": "and so the monks kept on asking and begging, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6:1.1.8": "Just then Venerable Mahākassapa, after completing the rainy-season residence at Rājagaha, set out for Āḷavī. ",
