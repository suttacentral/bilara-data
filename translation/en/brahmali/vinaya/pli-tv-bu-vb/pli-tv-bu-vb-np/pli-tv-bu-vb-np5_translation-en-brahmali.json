  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.8": "He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.9": "“If my sons and brothers see this nun, they’ll harass her,” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.10": "and he took a different path. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.11": "Soon afterwards, when the meat was cooked, he took some of the best meat, tied it up in a palm-leaf packet, hung it from a tree not far from Uppalavaṇṇā, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.12": "“Whatever acetic or brahmin sees this gift, please take it.” And he left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.1.13": "Uppalavaṇṇā had just emerged from stillness when she heard the head bandit making that statement. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.9": "“It’s hard for women to get material support, and this is one of my five robes. I don’t have any other. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.10": "I can’t give it away.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.11": "“Sister, just as a man giving an elephant might decorate its girth, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.13": "Being pressured by Udāyī, Uppalavaṇṇā gave him her sarong and then returned to her dwelling place. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.14": "The nuns who received Uppalavaṇṇā’s bowl and robe asked her, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.15": "“Venerable, where’s your sarong?” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.22": "After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:1.2.24": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.3": "“How can they not receive robes from us in exchange?” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.5": "and they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np5:2.6": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
