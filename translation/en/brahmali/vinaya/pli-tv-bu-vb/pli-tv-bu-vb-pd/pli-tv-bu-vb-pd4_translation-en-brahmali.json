  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.8": "the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.9": "The Sakyan men then came out and got hold of those thieves together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.10": "“How can they not announce that there are bandits staying in the monastery?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.11": "The monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.12": "and they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.13": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.14": "“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.
