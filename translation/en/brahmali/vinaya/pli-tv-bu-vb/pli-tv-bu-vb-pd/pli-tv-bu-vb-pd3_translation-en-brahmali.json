  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.3": "They were growing in faith, but declining in wealth. Whatever food they had in the morning, they gave to the monks. Sometimes they went without food. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.8": "and they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.9": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3:1.10": "“Monks, if a family’s faith is growing, but its wealth is declining, I allow you to designate it as ‘in training’, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. ",
