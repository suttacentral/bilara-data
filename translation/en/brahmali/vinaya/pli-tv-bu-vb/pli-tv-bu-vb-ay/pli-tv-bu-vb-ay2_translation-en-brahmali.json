  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.2": "At this time Venerable Udāyī knew that the Buddha had prohibited sitting alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action, and so instead he sat alone in private with the same girl. When they were able, they just chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.3": "A second time Visākhā had been invited to that family. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.4": "When she arrived, she saw Udāyī sitting alone in private with the same girl, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.5": "and she said to Udāyī, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.6": "“Venerable, it’s not appropriate for you to sit alone with a woman on a private seat. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.7": "Although you may not be aiming at that act, people with little confidence are hard to convince.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.12": "After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay2:1.13": "“Is it true, Udāyī, that you sat alone with a woman on a private seat?” ",
