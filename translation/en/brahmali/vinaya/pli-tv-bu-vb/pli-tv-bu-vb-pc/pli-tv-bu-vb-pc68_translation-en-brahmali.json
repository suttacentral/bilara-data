  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.2": "At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.3": "“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.4": "A number of monks heard ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.5": "that Ariṭṭha had that view. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.8": "They went to him and asked, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.9": "“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.10": "that you have such a view?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.11": "“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.12": "“No, Ariṭṭha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.13": "The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.14": "The Buddha has said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.15": "The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.16": "similar to a piece of meat … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.17": "similar to a grass torch … ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.25": "But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.27": "Since they were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.28": "Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.29": "“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a view?” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.33": "Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.34": "I have said that there is little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68:1.45": "And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. ",
