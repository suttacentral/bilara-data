  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.2": "At that time in Rājagaha there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.3": "with the boy Upāli as their leader. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.4": "Upāli’s parents considered, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.7": "He could become a scribe, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.16": "But these Sakyan ascetics have pleasant habits and a happy life. After eating nice food, they sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.17": "If Upāli goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.19": "He then went to the other boys and said, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.21": "“If you go forth, so will we.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.23": "“Please allow me to go forth from home to homelessness.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.25": "Since the parents knew that the boys all had the same desire and good intention, they gave their approval. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.26": "The boys then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.27": "And the monks gave them both the going forth and the full ordination. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.28": "Soon afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.40": "He asked Venerable Ānanda what was going on, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.42": "and Ānanda told him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.43": "Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: ",
