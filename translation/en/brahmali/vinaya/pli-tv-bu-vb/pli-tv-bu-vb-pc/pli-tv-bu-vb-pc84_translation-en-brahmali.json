  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.1": "At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.2": "a monk was bathing in the river Aciravatī, when a brahmin, too, came there to bathe. He deposited a bag with five hundred coins on the ground, bathed, forgot about the bag, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.3": "The monk thought, “This is the bag belonging to that brahmin; it wouldn’t be nice if it got lost,” and he picked it up. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.4": "Soon the brahmin remembered. He hurried back and asked that monk, “Sir, did you see my bag?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.5": "Saying, “I did indeed,” he gave it to him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.6": "The brahmin thought, “How can I avoid giving a reward to this monk?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.7": "And he said, “I didn’t have five hundred coins, I had a thousand!” And he seized hold of that monk. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.8": "After being released, that monk went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.9": "The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.10": "“How could a monk pick up precious things?” … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.11": "“Is it true, monk, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.12": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.13": "The Buddha rebuked him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.14": "“… Foolish man, how could you do this? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.15": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.16": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.17.0": "First preliminary ruling ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.17.1": "‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:1.18": "In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.0": "Second sub-story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.1": "Soon afterwards they were holding a celebration in Sāvatthī, with people going to the park all dressed up, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.2": "as did Visākhā Migāramātā. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.3": "As she was leaving her village, she thought, “What will I do when I get to the park? Why don’t I pay a visit to the Buddha!” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.4": "She then removed all her ornaments, bound them in a bundle with her upper robe, and gave it to her slave girl, saying, “Listen, look after this bundle.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.5": "Visākhā then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.6": "And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.7": "And the slave girl left too, forgetting the bundle. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.8": "The monks saw it and told the Buddha. “Well then, monks, pick it up and put it aside.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.9": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:2.10": "“Within a monastery, monks, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ‘Whoever owns this will come and get it.’ ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.1": "At that time the householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a whole village working for him in the country of Kāsī, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.2": "and he had told an apprentice there that if the monks arrived he should make them a meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.3": "Soon afterwards a number of monks were wandering in the country of Kāsī, when they came to that village. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.4": "When that man saw them coming, he approached them, bowed, and said, “Venerables, please accept a meal from Anāthapiṇḍika tomorrow.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.5": "The monks accepted by remaining silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.6": "The following morning, after getting various kinds of fine food prepared, he had the monks informed that it was time for the meal. He removed a ring from his finger and then offered the food to the monks, saying, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.7": "“Venerables, please leave after you’ve eaten. I have to go to work.” And he left, forgetting his ring. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.8": "The monks saw it and said, “If we just go, this ring will be lost,” and so they stayed right there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.9": "When that man returned from work, he saw the monks and said to them, “Why are you still here?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.10": "And the monks told him what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.11": "Those monks then went to Sāvatthī where they told the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.12": "who in turn told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.13": "After giving a teaching, the Buddha addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84:3.14": "“Within a monastery, monks, or inside a lodging, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ",
