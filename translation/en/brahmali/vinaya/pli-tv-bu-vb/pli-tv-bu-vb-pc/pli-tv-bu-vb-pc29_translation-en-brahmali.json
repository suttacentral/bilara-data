  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.2": "At that time the nun Thullanandā was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.3": "On one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.4": "Just then the nun Thullanandā robed up in the morning, took her bowl and robe, and went to that family. And she asked the head of the family, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.5": "“Why have you prepared so much food?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.6": "“Because, Venerable, I’ve invited the senior monks.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.7": "“But who are those senior monks?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.8": "“Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, and Venerable Rāhula.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.9": "“But why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great ones?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.10": "“Who are these great monks?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.11": "“Venerable Devadatta, Venerable Kokālika, Venerable Kaṭamodakatissaka, Venerable Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Venerable Samuddadatta.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.12": "While this conversation was still taking place, the senior monks entered. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.13": "Thullanandā said, “Is it true that you’ve invited these great monks?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.14": "“Just before you called them inferior monks, and now you call them great monks.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.15": "And that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.16": "The monks of few desires complained and criticized Devadatta, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.17": "“How can Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared?” … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.18": "“Is it true, Devadatta, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.19": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.20": "The Buddha rebuked him, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:1.22": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.0": "Second sub-story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.1": "Soon afterwards a monk who had earlier left Rājagaha returned to see his family. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.2": "Because it was long since he had last returned, people prepared food for him respectfully. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.3": "And the nun who was associating with that family said to them, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.8": "After returning to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.9": "and they in turn told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.10": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:2.11": "“Monks, I allow you to eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared if the householder had already intended to prepare it. ",
