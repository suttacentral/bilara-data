  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.2": "At that time the senior monks were instructing the nuns in turn, and on one occasion it was the turn of Venerable Cūḷapanthaka. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.3": "The nuns said, “Today the instruction won’t be effective, since Venerable Cūḷapanthaka will just be repeating the same utterance over and over.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.4": "Soon afterwards those nuns went to Cūḷapanthaka, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.5": "Cūḷapanthaka then said to them, “Are you all present, Sisters?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.6": "“We’re all present, Venerable.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.7": "“Are you keeping the eight important principles?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.8": "“We are.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9": "After saying, “This is the instruction,” he spoke the same utterance again and again: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.10": "“For the heedful one possessed of the higher mind, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.11": "For the sage training on the path to sagacity, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.12": "There are no sorrows for such a one, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.13": "The peaceful one, who is always mindful.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.14": "And the nuns said, “Didn’t we say that the instruction wouldn’t be effective, that Venerable Cūḷapanthaka would just be repeating the same utterance over and over?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.15": "But Cūḷapanthaka overheard that conversation between the nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.16": "He then rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and he disappeared, all the while speaking the same utterance and many other sayings by the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.17": "And the nuns said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.18": "“It’s astonishing and amazing! ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.19": "No previous instruction has been as effective as this one from Venerable Cūḷapanthaka!” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.20": "And Cūḷapanthaka kept on instructing those nuns until the dark of night, and then dismissed them, saying, “Go, Sisters.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.21": "But because the gates to the town were closed, those nuns stayed the night outside and entered early in the morning. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.22": "People complained and criticized them, “These nuns aren’t celibate. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.23": "They spend the night in the monastery with the monks and only now do they enter the town.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.24": "The monks heard the complaints of those people, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.25": "and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Cūḷapanthaka, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.26": "“How can Venerable Cūḷapanthaka instruct the nuns after the sun has set?”… ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.27": "“Is it true, Cūḷapanthaka, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.28": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.29": "The Buddha rebuked him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.30": "“… Cūḷapanthaka, how can you instruct the nuns after the sun has set? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.31": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
