  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.2": "At that time the Sangha was receiving an abundance of non-staple food. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.3": "Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha, who said, “Well then, Ānanda, give the pastries to those who take leftovers.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.4": "“Yes, Sir.” Ānanda had them to sit in a row and gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to a female wanderer. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.5": "The female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This ascetic is your lover.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.6": "“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.7": "And a second time … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.8": "And a third time Ānanda gave them one pastry each, until he accidentally gave two to that same female wanderer. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.9": "Once again the female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This ascetic is your lover.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.10": "“He’s not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.1.11": "And they started to argue about whether or not they were lovers. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.1": "A certain Ājīvaka ascetic, too, went to that distribution of food. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.2": "A monk mixed rice with a large amount of ghee and gave him a large lump. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.3": "He took it and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.4": "Another Ājīvaka asked him, “Where did you get that lump?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.5": "“From the food distribution of the ascetic Gotama, that shaven-headed householder.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.6": "Some lay followers overheard that conversation between those Ājīvaka ascetics. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.7": "They then approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.8": "“Venerable Sir, these ascetics of other religions want to disparage the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.9": "It would be good if the monks didn’t give anything to the ascetics of other religions from their own hands.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.10": "After the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened those lay followers with a teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right side toward him, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.11": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.12": "“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.13": "for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41:1.2.14": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: ",
