  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.2": "the monks were bathing in the hot springs. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.3": "On that occasion King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to wash his head, and he went to the hot springs. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.4": "He waited respectfully for the monks to finish, but they kept on bathing until dark. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.5": "Only then was King Bimbisāra able to wash his head. But because the town gates had been shut, he had to spend the night outside the city. In the morning, with his make-up still on, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.6": "he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.7": "The Buddha said to him, “Great King, why have you come so early in the morning with your make-up still on?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.8": "The King told him what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.9": "The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which the King got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.10": "Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: ",
