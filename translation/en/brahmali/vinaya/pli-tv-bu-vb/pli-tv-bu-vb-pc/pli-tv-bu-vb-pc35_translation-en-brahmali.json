  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.3": "When the monks had finished and refused an invitation to eat more, they went to their respective families, where some ate and some took away almsfood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.4": "Soon afterwards that brahmin said to his neighbors, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.8": "Those monks who were invited by you came to our houses. Some of them ate there and some took away almsfood.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.9": "That brahmin complained and criticized those monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.10": "“How can the venerables eat in our house and afterwards eat elsewhere? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.11": "Am I not able to give them as much as they need?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.12": "The monks heard the complaints of that brahmin, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:1.13": "and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.1": "Soon afterwards the monks were bringing back fine almsfood for the sick monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.2": "But because they were not able to eat as much as they had intended, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.3": "the monks threw the leftovers away. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.4": "The Buddha heard the loud sound of crows cawing, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.7": "Ānanda told him what had happened, and the Buddha said, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.9": "“No, Sir, they don’t.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35:2.10": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
