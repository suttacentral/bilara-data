  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.8": "They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.1.9": "“Monks, I allow you to accept an invitation to supply tonics for four months.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.1": "Yet the monks only asked Mahānāma for a small amount of tonics, and so he still had an abundance. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.2.2": "A second time he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.7": "They then went to Mahānāma and said, “We need a _doṇa_ measure of ghee.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47:1.4.16": "They then said, “Why do you give an invitation if you don’t wish to give?” ",
