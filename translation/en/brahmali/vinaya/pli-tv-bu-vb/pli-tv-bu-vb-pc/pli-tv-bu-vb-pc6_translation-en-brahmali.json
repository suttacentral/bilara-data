  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.0": "Origin story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.2": "One evening as Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī, he arrived at a certain village. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.3": "Just then a woman in that village had prepared her guesthouse. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.4": "Anuruddha approached that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.5": "“Please stay, Venerable.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.6": "Other travelers also approached that woman and said, “Madam, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.7": "“Sirs, an ascetic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.8": "Those travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “If it’s not troublesome for you, Venerable, we’d like to stay one night in the guesthouse.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.9": "“Please stay.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.10": "Now as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.11": "She now approached him and said, “Sir, you won’t be at ease surrounded by these people. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.12": "It would be good if I prepared a bed for you in the main house.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.13": "Anuruddha consented by remaining silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.14": "After preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she approached Anuruddha and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.15": "“Sir, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.16": "It would be good, Sir, if I were to become your wife.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.17": "But Anuruddha remained silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.18": "She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.19": "And a third time she said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.20": "“Sir, you’re good-looking and graceful, and so am I. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.21": "It would be good, Sir, if you took me and all this property.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.22": "Once again Anuruddha remained silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.23": "She then threw off her wrap, and she walked up and down, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.24": "But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.25": "Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.26": "Many people send for me with a hundred or a thousand coins. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.27": "But this ascetic, even when begged by me, doesn’t want me and all this property.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.28": "After dressing, she bowed down with her head at Anuruddha’s feet and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.29": "“Sir, I’ve committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully I acted like this. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.30": "Please accept my confession for my future restraint.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.31": "“Certainly you have committed an offense. Foolishly, deludedly, and unskillfully you acted like this. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.32": "But since you acknowledge your offense and you make amends for it in accordance with the Teaching, I accept your confession. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.33": "For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones, that is, acknowledging an offense, making amends in accordance with the Teaching, and undertaking restraint for the future.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.34": "The following morning that woman personally served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine food. When he had finished his meal, she bowed and sat down to one side. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.35": "And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.36": "She then said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.37": "“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.38": "Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.39": "even so has Anuruddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.40": "I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.41": "Please accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.42": "Soon afterwards, after arriving at Sāvatthī, Anuruddha told the monks what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.43": "The monks of few desires complained and criticized Anuruddha, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.44": "“How can Venerable Anuruddha lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.45": "After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Anuruddha: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.46": "“Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.47": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.48": "The Buddha rebuked him … “Anuruddha, how can you lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.49": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.50": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.51.1": "‘If a monk lay down in the same sleeping place as a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” ",
