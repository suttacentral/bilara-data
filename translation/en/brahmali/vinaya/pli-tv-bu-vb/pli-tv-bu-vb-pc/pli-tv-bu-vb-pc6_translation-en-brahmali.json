  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.0": "Origin story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.1": "At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.2": "Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to Sāvatthī, when one evening he arrived at a certain village. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.3": "Just then a woman in that village had prepared her guesthouse. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.4": "Anuruddha went to that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.5": "“Please stay, Venerable.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.6": "Other travelers also went to that woman and said, “Madam, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.7": "“Sirs, a monastic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.8": "Those travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “If you don’t mind, Venerable, we’d like to stay one night in the guesthouse.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.9": "“No problem.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.10": "Now as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.11": "She now went to him and said, “Sir, you won’t be comfortable surrounded by these people. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.12": "Why don’t I prepare a bed for you in the main house?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.13": "Anuruddha consented by remaining silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.14": "After preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she went to Anuruddha and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.15": "“You’re attractive, Sir, and so am I. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.16": "Why don’t you take me as your wife?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.17": "But Anuruddha remained silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.18": "She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.19": "And a third time she said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.20": "“You’re attractive, Sir, and so am I. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.21": "Why don’t you take me and all this property?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.22": "Once again Anuruddha remained silent. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.23": "She then threw off her wrap, and she walked up and down, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.24": "But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.25": "Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.26": "Many people pay a hundred or a thousand coins to be with me. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.27": "But this monastic doesn’t want me and all this property, even when I beg him!” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.28": "After dressing, she bowed down with her head at Anuruddha’s feet and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.29": "“Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.30": "Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.31": "“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.32": "But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.33": "For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.34": "The following morning that woman personally served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine food. When he had finished his meal, she bowed and sat down to one side. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.35": "And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.36": "She then said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.37": "“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.38": "Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what had been hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.39": "even so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.40": "I go for refuge to the Buddha and to the Teaching and to the Sangha of monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.41": "Please accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.42": "Soon afterwards, after arriving at Sāvatthī, Anuruddha told the monks what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.43": "The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.44": "“How can Venerable Anuruddha lie down in the same sleeping place as a woman?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.45": "After rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Anuruddha: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.46": "“Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.47": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.48": "The Buddha rebuked him … “Anuruddha, how could you do this? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.49": "This won’t give rise to or increase people’s confidence … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.50": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.51.0": "Final ruling ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc6:1.51.1": "‘If a monk lies down in the same sleeping place as a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” ",
