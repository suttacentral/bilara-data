  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.3": "After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.4": "Just then the housewife was sitting at the entrance door and the daughter-in-law at the door to one of the rooms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.5": "Udāyī went up to the housewife and gave her a teaching, whispering in her ear. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.6": "And the daughter-in-law thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.7": "“Is this ascetic my mother-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.8": "After teaching the housewife in this way, Udāyī approached the daughter-in-law and gave her a teaching in the same way. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.9": "Then the housewife thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.10": "“Is this ascetic my daughter-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc7:1.11": "After giving a teaching in this way, Udāyī left. ",
