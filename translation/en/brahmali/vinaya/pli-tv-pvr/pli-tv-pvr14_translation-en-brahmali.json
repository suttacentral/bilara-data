  "pli-tv-pvr14:1.1": "When a monk who is engaged in conflict is approaching an Order he should approach the Order with a humble mind, with a mind as though (it were) removing dust.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:1.2": "He should be skilled about seats and skilled about sitting down.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:1.3": "He should sit down on a suitable seat without encroaching on (the space intended for) monks who are Elders and without keeping newly ordained monks from a seat.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:1.4": "He should not talk in a desultory fashion, nor about inferior (worldly) matters.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:1.5": "Either he should speak _Dhamma_ himself or should ask another to do so, or he should not disdain the ariyan silence.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:2.1": "A preceptor should not be asked about by an Order, by an approved individual, by an adjudicator, by one anxious to adjudicate; a teacher should not be asked about, one who shares a cell … a pupil … a fellow-preceptor … a fellow-teacher should not be asked about; birth should not be asked about, name … clan … the (scriptural) tradition … the family’s standing … the native district should not be asked about.",

  "pli-tv-pvr14:3.1": "There should be respect for an Order, for an approved individual, for an adjudicator, for one anxious to adjudicate, not respect for an individual. There should be respect for True _Dhamma_, not respect for the material things of the world. There should be pursuit of the goal, not conformity to an assembly. One should adjudicate at a right time, not at a wrong time; one should adjudicate about what is fact, not about what is not fact; one should adjudicate gently, not harshly; one should adjudicate about what is connected with the goal, not about what is not connected with the goal; one should adjudicate with a mind of loving-kindness, not with inner hatred. There should not be murmuring in his ear, he should not seek what is crooked, he should not cover his eye, he should not raise his eye-brow, he should not raise his head, he should not make a movement with his hand, he should not give a gesture with the hand.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:4.1": "He should be skilled about seats, he should be skilled about sitting down; looking a plough’s length ahead, pursuing the goal he should sit down on his own seat and should not rise from the seat, he should not pass beyond (the judgement), he should not follow a wrong way; he should not speak waving his arms about, he should be unhastening, he should be considerate, he should not be quick tempered, with a mind of loving-kindness he should be gentle in speech; merciful, he should be compassionate for welfare; seeking for welfare, he should not be frivolous in speech; limiting his speech, he should be one who masters hostility, and is without irascibility. The self must be assessed, the other must be assessed, the reprover must be assessed, the reproved must be assessed, one who reproves not by rule … one who is reproved not by rule … one who reproves by rule … one who is reproved by rule must be assessed. Without omitting what was said, not bringing forward what was not said, having properly learnt the words and sentences as given, questioning the other in return, he should deal with him according to his acknowledgement. An indolent person should be roused, a fearful one given confidence, a violent one checked, an impure one put right, a straight one (treated) with mildness. He should not follow a wrong course from partiality … hatred … confusion … fear. He should be balanced as to the rules and the individuals.",
  "pli-tv-pvr14:4.2": "Thus is an adjudicator when he adjudicates thus both a doer of the Teacher’s Dispensation, and is dear to learned men and to his fellow Brahma-farers and liked by them and he is esteemed and to be respected.",
