  "sa139:2.1" : "It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, ",
  "sa139:2.2" : "“What is it that exists, that arises, that ties, that’s an attachment, and that’s viewed as self and causes grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have yet to arise to arise and grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have arisen to deepen and increase?” ",
  "sa139:3.1" : "The monks said to the Buddha, ",
  "sa139:3.2" : "“The Bhagavān is the Dharma root, the Dharma eye, and the Dharma refuge. ",

  "sa139:4.1" : "The Buddha addressed the monks, ",
  "sa139:4.2" : "“It’s because form exists, because form arises, because form ties and becomes an attachment that form is viewed as self. ",

  "sa139:8.2" : "“It’s painful, Bhagavān!” ",
  "sa139:9.1" : "“So it is, monks. ",
  "sa139:9.2" : "If something is impermanent, then it’s painful. ",
  "sa139:9.3" : "Because this pain exists, these things arise, tie, become attachments, and are viewed as self. ",
  "sa139:9.4" : "Grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have yet to arise are made to arise, and grief, sorrow, vexation, and pain that have arisen are deepened and increased. ",
  "sa139:9.5" : "Feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness are likewise. ",
  "sa139:10.1" : "“Therefore, monks, no forms exist in the past, future, or present, whether internal or external, coarse or fine, lovely or ugly, and far or near that are self or different than self, and [the two] are not present in each other. ",

  "sa139:10.3" : "Feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness are likewise. ",

  "sa139:12.1" : "“If someone’s view is that there’s a self, a world, or this and another world that are permanent, eternal, and unchanging, all these are not self or different than self, and [the two] are not present in each other. ",
  "sa139:12.2" : "This is called right wisdom. ",
  "sa139:13.1" : "“Again, if someone’s view is that it’s not this world that’s self or self-possessed and not the future that’s self or self-possessed, all these are not self or different than self, and [the two] are not present in each other. ",
