# bilara-data

This repository contains the published and unpublished translations, root texts, and other data from the Bilara translation app.

The **published** branch is the main branch and contains finished translations and other texts which can considered to be proofed. 

In software terms it can be considered to be “stable”.

The **unpublished** branch contains translations which are still in progress.

In software terms it can be considered to be the “develop” branch. There should be no data integrity issues but there are no guarantee about the content.

## Warning

Pull Requests such as from a fork should not be made against published branch. Instead pull requests should be made against the unpublished branch.
